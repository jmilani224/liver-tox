          <title>Introduction</title>
          <p>The selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERMs) are a group of nonsteroidal compounds that have estrogen-like effects (agonism) on some tissues (such as bone, skin, heart or vaginal epithelium), but antiestrogen effects (antagonism) on other tissues (such as breast or uterus). Depending on the tissue specificity and balance of the agonist and antagonist activities, these agents have different clinical effects, different indications and different adverse side effects. Typical indications for SERMS include treatment or prevention of breast cancer (tamoxifen, toremifene, raloxifene), treatment or prevention of postmenopausal osteoporosis (raloxifene, bazedoxifene) and amelioration of symptoms of menopause symptoms (ospemifene). Separate documents for the SERMs that are used largely for prevention of cancer, tamoxifen and toremifene, are available in LiverTox. This document summaries background information and the potential hepatotoxicity of raloxifene, bazedoxifene and ospemifene, SERMs used for treatment of nonmalignant conditions such as osteoporosis and menopausal symptoms of hot flashes and dyspareunia.</p>

            <title>Background</title>
            <p>Raloxifene (ral ox' i feen) is a selective estrogen receptor modulator that has estrogen-like effects (agonism) on bone and the cardiovascular system but antiestrogen activity (antagonism) on breast and uterus tissue. This differential activity takes advantage of the beneficial effects of estrogens on bone in decreasing bone resorption and turnover and thus preventing osteoporosis, while avoiding the potential harmful effects of estrogen stimulation of breast and uterine tissue. In several large clinical trials, raloxifene was shown to increase bone mineral density and prevent bone fractures in postmenopausal women at high risk for osteoporosis, while decreasing serum cholesterol levels (both total and LDL) and without stimulating breast and uterine growth. Raloxifene was approved for treatment and prevention of postmenopausal osteoporosis in the United States in 1997, and indications were expanded in 2007 to include reduction of risk of breast cancer in postmenopausal women with osteoporosis as well as those at high risk of breast cancer. Raloxifene is available in tablets of 60 mg generically and under the brand name Evista, and the recommended dose is 60 mg daily. Side effects are not common, but can include hot flashes, leg cramps, peripheral edema, arthralgias and sweating. Rare, but potentially severe adverse events include deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism and ischemic strokes, side effects that it shares with estrogen.</p>

            <title>Hepatotoxicity</title>
            <p>In large, prelicensure clinical trials, the rate of serum enzyme elevations during raloxifene therapy was less than 1% and was no higher than with placebo or comparator arms. In addition, no episodes of hepatitis or clinically apparent liver injury attributable to raloxifene were reported. In the two decades since its approval and wide scale use, there have been isolated reports of liver injury attributed to raloxifene. One report described a case of cholestatic hepatitis arising a month after starting raloxifene which resolved with stopping, but full recovery was delayed (Case 1). The injury was accompanied by mild immunoallergic features, but autoantibodies were not present. A second case of cholestatic hepatitis was reported in a patient on long term raloxifene who had been started on fenofibrate two weeks before the onset of jaundice. The injury was attributed to the combination of the two agents and possible drug-drug interactions. Finally, several cases of an exacerbation of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis during raloxifene therapy have been reported, a pattern of injury that has been reported more commonly with tamoxifen. Thus, raloxifene may be a rare cause of liver injury, but the relationship to the drug has not been very well established.</p>

            <title>Mechanism of Injury</title>
            <p>The reason why raloxifene might cause liver injury is not known, but the isolated cholestatic cases appear to be due to an idiosyncratic hypersensitivity reaction. Raloxifene is metabolized in the liver by glucuronidation and it has minimal effects on cytochrome P450 enzymes (CYP).</p>

            <title>Outcome and Management</title>
            <p>Serum enzyme elevations are uncommon during raloxifene therapy and are rarely dose limiting. While clinically apparent liver injury with jaundice has been reported with raloxifene therapy, it is very rare. Evaluation should include assessment of hepatic steatosis by ultrasound or other imaging modalities. There is no known cross sensitivity to hepatic injury among the SERMs or with other agents for osteoporosis. On the other hand, restarting raloxifene after clinically apparent liver injury cannot be recommended.</p>

          <p>A 49 year old postmenopausal woman with osteoporosis developed fatigue and rash approximately one month after starting raloxifene and calcium for postmenopausal osteoporosis. She stopped her medications, but 5 days later developed jaundice and sought medical advice. She had no history of liver disease and had normal liver tests before starting raloxifene. On examination, she was jaundiced and had a mild, morbilliform rash. She did not have fever or signs of chronic liver disease. Laboratory tests showed total bilirubin of 6.2 mg/dL, ALT 291 U/L, AST 224 U/L, alkaline phosphatase 643 U/L and slightly elevated eosinophil counts (Table). Tests for hepatitis A, B and C were negative as were routine autoantibodies. Abdominal ultrasound showed no evidence of biliary obstruction or hepatic masses. Serum enzyme levels slowly improved, but bilirubin levels rose to a peak of 15.1 mg/dL. She developed pruritus, but eventually improved with resolution of jaundice and symptoms. Serum alkaline phosphatase levels, however, remained high.</p>

            <p>This brief report described a woman with osteoporosis who developed a somewhat prolonged cholestatic hepatitis one month after starting raloxifene. The injury was accompanied by rash and eosinophilia suggestive of an immunoallergic hypersensitivity reaction. She was symptomatic for more than a month, and serum alkaline phosphatase levels were still 3 times the upper limit of normal four months after stopping the drug. Little else besides biliary tract disease could cause this clinical picture, and this report remains the most convincing report of clinically apparent liver injury from raloxifene.</p>

          <p>Bazedoxifene (ba" ze dox' i feen) is a selective estrogen receptor modulator that is used to prevent osteoporosis in menopausal women and for treatment of moderate-to-severe vasomotor symptoms associated with menopause (hot flashes, sweating). Bazedoxifene has estrogen-like effects (agonism) on bone and the cardiovascular system, but antiestrogen activity (antagonism) on breast and uterus tissue. This differential activity is keyed to achieving the beneficial effects of estrogens on bone in decreasing bone resorption and turnover and thus preventing osteoporosis, but avoiding the potential harmful effects of estrogen stimulation of breast and uterine tissue. While bazedoxifene by itself is approved for use in several other countries of the world, in the United States it is approved only as a combination product with low doses of conjugated estrogens. In short term trials the combination of bazedoxifene and estrogens was shown to decrease menopause associated hot flushes. Longer term trials of this combination have documented its efficacy in preventing osteoporosis in postmenopausal women. The fixed combination of bazedoxifene (20 mg) and conjugated estrogens (0.45 mg) was approved for use in the United States under the brand name Duavee in 2013. Common side effects include muscle spasms, nausea, diarrhea, dyspepsia, dizziness and abdominal, throat and neck pain. Potential long term, severe adverse events include deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism and ischemic strokes and the possible long term effects of estrogens such as increased risk of breast, endometrial and ovarian cancer and gallbladder disease.</p>

Ospemifene was approved for treatment of moderate-to-severe symptoms of dyspareunia in postmenopausal women in the United States in 2013. It is not approved for treatment or prevention of osteoporosis. Ospemifene is available in tablets of 60 mg under the brand name Osphena and the recommended dose is 60 mg daily.

          <p>Likelihood score: E (unlikely cause of clinically apparent liver injury).</p>

        <sec id="SERMS.Mechanism_of_Injury3">
          <title>Mechanism of Injury</title>
          <p>The reason why ospemifene might cause liver injury is not known, but isolated idiosyncratic cases of cholestatic hepatitis have been linked to therapy with other SERMs. Ospemifene is metabolized in the liver by glucuronidation and has minimal effects on cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzyme activity.</p>

        <sec id="SERMS.Outcome_and_Management3">
          <title>Outcome and Management</title>
          <p>Serum enzyme elevations are uncommon during ospemifene therapy and are rarely dose limiting. There is no known cross sensitivity to hepatic injury among the SERMs.</p>
