          <title>Introduction</title>
          <p>Estazolam is an orally available benzodiazepine used to treat insomnia. As with most benzodiazepines, estazolam therapy has not associated with serum aminotransferase or alkaline phosphatase elevations, and clinically apparent liver injury from estazolam has not been reported and must be very rare, if it occurs at all.</p>
        </sec>
        <sec id="Estazolam.Background">
          <title>Background</title>
          <p>Estazolam (es taz' oh lam) is a benzodiazepine used as a sleeping aid in the therapy of insomnia. The antianxiety (anxiolytic) and soporific activity of the benzodiazepines is mediated by their ability to enhance gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) mediated inhibition of synaptic transmission through binding to the GABA A receptor. Estazolam was approved in the United States in 1990 for the short term management of insomnia. Estazolam is available in tablets of 1 and 2 mg in several generic forms and formerly under the brand name ProSom. The recommended initial oral dose for adults is 1 mg at bedtime, which can be increased to 2 mg nightly, but is not recommended as chronic therapy. The most common side effects of estazolam are dose related and include daytime drowsiness, lethargy, ataxia, dysarthria and dizziness. Tolerance develops to these side effects, but tolerance may also develop to the effects on insomnia.</p>
        </sec>
        <sec id="Estazolam.Hepatotoxicity">
          <title>Hepatotoxicity</title>
          <p>Estazolam, as with other benzodiazepines, is rarely associated with serum ALT elevations, and clinically apparent liver injury from estazolam is extremely rare, if it occurs at all. There have been no case reports of symptomatic, acute liver injury from estazolam. Cases of clinically apparent hepatitis have been reported with other benzodiazepines including alprazolam, chlordiazepoxide, clonazepam, diazepam, flurazepam and triazolam. The clinical pattern of acute liver injury from benzodiazepines is typically cholestatic and mild-to-moderate in severity with a latency of 1 to 6 months. Fever and rash have not been described nor has autoantibody formation.</p>
          <p>Likelihood score: E (Unlikely cause of clinically apparent liver injury).</p>
        </sec>
        <sec id="Estazolam.Mechanism_of_Injury">
          <title>Mechanism of Injury</title>
          <p>Estazolam is metabolized by the liver to inactive metabolites and excreted in the urine. Liver injury from benzodiazepines is probably due to the toxic effects of a rarely produced intermediate metabolite.</p>
        </sec>
        <sec id="Estazolam.Outcome_and_Management">
          <title>Outcome and Management</title>
          <p>The case reports of hepatic injury due to benzodiazepines were followed by prompt and complete recovery upon stopping the medication, without evidence of residual or chronic injury. No cases of acute liver failure or chronic liver injury due to estazolam have been described. There is no information about cross reactivity with other benzodiazepines, but some degree of cross sensitivity may occur.</p>
