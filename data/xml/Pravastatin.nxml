          <title>Introduction</title>
          <p>Pravastatin is a commonly used cholesterol lowering agent (statin) that is associated with mild, asymptomatic and self-limited serum aminotransferase elevations during therapy, and rarely with clinically apparent acute liver injury.</p>
        </sec>
        <sec id="Pravastatin.Background">
          <title>Background</title>
          <p>Pravastatin (pra" va stat' in) is an orally available inhibitor of hepatic 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase, the major rate-limiting enzyme in cholesterol synthesis. Like other members of its class (the &#x0201c;statins&#x0201d;), pravastatin lowers total serum cholesterol and low densitylipoprotein (LDL) concentrations, thereby reducing the risk of atherosclerosis and its complications &#x02013; myocardial infarction and stroke. Pravastatin was approved for use in the United States in 1991 and continues to be widely used with more than 9 million prescriptions filled yearly. Current indications are for treatment of hypercholesterolemia in persons at high risk for coronary, cerebrovascular and peripheral artery disease. Pravastatin is available in tablets of 10, 20, 40 and 80 mg in several generic forms and under the brand name of Pravachol. The recommended dose in adults is 40 to 80 mg once daily. Common side effects include muscle cramps, joint aches, headache and weakness.</p>
        </sec>
        <sec id="Pravastatin.Hepatotoxicity">
          <title>Hepatotoxicity</title>
          <p>Pravastatin therapy is associated with mild, asymptomatic and usually transient serum aminotransferase elevations. In summary analyses of large scale studies with prospective monitoring, ALT elevations above normal occurred in 3% to 15% of patients; but levels above 3 times the upper limit of normal (ULN) occurred in only 0.7% of pravastatin treated compared to 0.3% of placebo recipients. These elevations were more common with higher doses of pravastatin, being 2.3% with 80 mg daily. Most of these elevations were self-limited and did not require dose modification. Pravastatin has been only rarely associated with clinically apparent hepatic injury with symptoms or jaundice at a rate estimated to be 1 per 100,000 users. In the case reports, latency varied from 2 to 9 months and the pattern of serum enzyme elevations from cholestatic to hepatocellular. Recovery was complete within a few months. Rash, fever and eosinophilia were uncommon as were autoantibodies, but few cases have been reported and the full clinical syndrome not well defined. Pravastatin appears to be less likely to cause clinically apparent liver injury than atorvastatin, simvastatin and rosuvastatin.</p>
          <p>Likelihood score: B (likely cause of clinically apparent liver injury).</p>
        </sec>
        <sec id="Pravastatin.Mechanism_of_Injury">
          <title>Mechanism of Injury</title>
          <p>The cause of hepatic injury from pravastatin is unknown. Pravastatin has only minimal hepatic metabolism and most is excreted unchanged in the urine. The mild, self-limited ALT elevations may be due to production of a minor toxic intermediate of metabolism and the reversal of these elevations due to adaptation. The idiosyncratic, clinically apparent liver injury associated with pravastatin may be due to failure of adaptation.</p>
        </sec>
        <sec id="Pravastatin.Outcome_and_Management">
          <title>Outcome and Management</title>
          <p>The mild ALT elevations associated with pravastatin therapy are usually self-limited and do not require dose modification, although pravastatin should be stopped if ALT levels rise above 10-fold the ULN, or persist in being above 5-fold elevated or are associated with symptoms. In the clinically apparent liver injury attributed to pravastatin, recovery is usually complete within 1 to 2 months. In view of the wide scale use of pravastatin, clinically apparent and severe liver injury is extraordinarily rare. Recurrence of injury with rechallenge has been reported and should be avoided. Switching therapy to another statin after pravastatin induced injury can lead to recurrence and should be done with careful monitoring.</p>

          <p>[Modified from: Hartleb M, Rymarczyk G, Januszewski K. Acute cholestatic hepatitis associated with pravastatin. Am J Gastroenterol 1999; 94: 1388-90. <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10235223">PubMed Citation</ext-link>]</p>
          <p>A 57 year old man developed abdominal pain and nausea followed by fever and jaundice 6 weeks after starting pravastatin (20 mg daily) for long standing hypercholesterolemia. He had a history of coronary artery disease and had been treated with beta blockers and various cholesterol lowering drugs, including fenofibrate and simvastatin in the past. At the time of presentation, he was taking only pravastatin and metoprolol, both of which were discontinued promptly. He denied alcohol use and had no risk factors for viral hepatitis. Physical examination showed jaundice and hepatic tenderness but no rash, fever or signs of chronic liver disease. Laboratory results showed a cholestatic pattern of serum enzyme elevations and hyperbilirubinemia (Table). Tests for hepatitis A, B and C were negative as were autoantibodies. Ultrasound and CT of the abdomen showed no evidence of biliary obstruction and ERCP was normal. A liver biopsy showed intrahepatic cholestasis compatible with drug induced liver injury. He was treated with ursodiol (750 mg daily). Once pravastatin was stopped, symptoms and liver test abnormalities improved rapidly and were completely normal 7 weeks later.</p>

            <p>The onset of injury within 2 months of starting pravastatin and resolution within 2 months of stopping is supportive evidence that this represented drug induced liver disease due to pravastatin. All other causes of acute liver injury were satisfactorily excluded. Metoprolol had been used for a longer period and, like other beta-blockers, is a rare cause of drug induced liver injury. The pattern of serum enzyme elevations was considered &#x0201c;mixed&#x0201d; but the clinical presentation, symptoms and liver histology were more cholestatic. This patient had previously tolerated simvastatin without obvious liver injury. Cross susceptibility to cholestatic hepatitis from the statins is frequent but not invariable.</p>
