          <title>Introduction</title>
          <p>Rifabutin is a rifamycin antibiotic that is similar in structure and activity to rifampin and rifapentine and which is used largely in the prevention of Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC) disease in patients with advanced HIV infection. Rifabutin is associated with transient and asymptomatic elevations in serum aminotransferase and is a likely cause of clinically apparent, acute liver disease.</p>
        </sec>
        <sec id="Rifabutin.Background">
          <title>Background</title>
          <p>Rifabutin (rif" a bue' tin) is a rifamycin antibiotic and a synthetic derivative of natural products of the bacterium, Amycolatopsis mediterranei. The rifamycins are complex macrocyclic antibiotics that have activity against several bacteria, but most prominently M. tuberculosis and several atypical mycobacterial species, probably as a result of inhibition of the DNA-dependent RNA polymerase of mycobacteria. These agents are considered bactericidal and are active against both intracellular and extracellular organisms. Rifabutin has similar activity and pharmacokinetics as rifampin, but it is less likely to induce hepatic microsomal, drug metabolizing enzymes and, thus, is an appropriate substitute for rifampin in patients on other medications that would be affected by alteration in the P450 system, such as some antiretroviral agents, benzodiazepines, cyclosporine, macrolide antibiotics, oral contraceptives, and warfarin. Rifabutin is available as 150 mg capsules under the trade name of Mycobutin. The current major indication is for prevention of mycobacterium avium complex (MAC) disease in patients with HIV infection, and treatment of tuberculosis is considered an off-label use. The recommended dose in adults is 300 mg daily in one or two divided doses. Pyridoxine (vitamin B6) is commonly given with rifabutin to prevent neuropathy. Side effects of rifabutin are uncommon, but include rash, fever, flu-like symptoms, gastrointestinal upset and orange discoloration of urine and sweat. Rifabutin has some, but far less activity than rifampin as an inducer of the hepatic microsomal drug metabolizing P450 enzymes (CYP 1A2, 2C9, 2C19 and 3A4), the relative potencies being: rifampin (1.0), rifapentine (0.85), and rifabutin (0.4). Nevertheless, use of other medications (such as birth control pills, beta-blockers, benzodiazepines, cyclosporine and oral anticoagulants) with rifabutin should be carefully considered and monitored. Rare but potentially severe adverse events include uveitis, hypersensitivity reactions and C. difficile diarrhea.</p>
        </sec>
        <sec id="Rifabutin.Hepatotoxicity">
          <title>Hepatotoxicity</title>
          <p>Because of its limited use, the effects of rifabutin on the liver have been less well defined than those of rifampin, but they are likely to be similar. Thus, studies on the prevention of MAC in HIV infected patients with rifabutin, minor, transient elevations in serum aminotransferase levels occurred in 3% to 8% of patients, but these abnormalities rarely required dose adjustment or discontinuation. Clinically apparent liver injury due to rifabutin has not been reported, but it is likely to be similar to rifampin in its potential for causing acute liver injury. Because rifabutin is usually given in combination with other agents used to treat HIV infection, the cause of the acute liver injury in patients on rifabutin-containing regimens may be difficult to relate to a single agent. Typically, the onset of injury due to rifampin is within 1 to 6 weeks and the serum enzyme pattern is usually hepatocellular at the onset of injury, but can cholestatic and mixed in contrast to isoniazid and pyrazinamide. Extrahepatic manifestations due to rifampin hepatotoxicity such as fever, rash, arthralgias, edema and eosinophilia are uncommon as is autoantibody formation. This potential for hepatotoxicity has not been demonstrated specifically for rifabutin, and some patients with apparent hepatotoxicity attributed to rifampin have tolerated rifabutin without recurrence of liver injury.</p>
          <p>Likelihood score: D (possible rare cause of clinically apparent liver injury).</p>
        </sec>
        <sec id="Rifabutin.Mechanism_of_Injury">
          <title>Mechanism of Injury</title>
          <p>The mechanism of rifamycin associated hepatotoxicity is not known, but these agents are extensively metabolized by the liver and induce multiple hepatic enzymes. Thus, the cause of injury is likely to be due to idiosyncratic metabolic products that are either directly toxic or induce an immunologic reaction.</p>
        </sec>
        <sec id="Rifabutin.Outcome_and_Management">
          <title>Outcome and Management</title>
          <p>For the rifamycins, the severity of hepatic injury ranges from asymptomatic elevations in serum aminotransferase levels, jaundice without apparent hepatic injury, symptomatic self-limited hepatitis to severe fulminant liver failure and death. In most cases, complete recovery is expected after stopping the drug and is usually rapid and complete. The rifamycins have not been associated with vanishing bile duct syndrome or chronic hepatitis. There is likely to be cross sensitivity to liver injury among the various rifamycins (rifampin, rifabutin, rifapentine), but not with other first or second line antituberculosis agents.</p>
          <p>[First line medications used in the therapy of tuberculosis in the US include ethambutol, isoniazid, pyrazinamide, rifabutin, rifampin, and rifapentine. Second line medications include streptomycin, capreomycin, cycloserine, ethionamide, fluoroquinolones such as levofloxacin and moxifloxacin, aminoglycosides such as amikacin, and para-aminosalicylic acid (PAS).] Specific, regularly updated recommendations on therapy of tuberculosis can be found on the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention website: https://www.cdc.gov/tb/topic/treatment/</p>
