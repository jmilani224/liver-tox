          <title>Introduction</title>
          <p>Rolapitant is an orally available antiemetic agent that is used to prevent cancer chemotherapy related nausea and vomiting. Rolapitant therapy has not been associated with serum enzyme elevations or with instances of clinically apparent liver injury with jaundice.</p>
        </sec>
        <sec id="Rolapitant.Background">
          <title>Background</title>
          <p>Rolapitant (roe la' pi tant) is a substance P/neurokinin 1 (NK-1) receptor antagonist which has potent and prolonged antiemetic activity. Rolapitant acts as a substance P antagonist blocking the neurokinin 1 (NK1) receptor, which is found in the central nervous system and induces the vomiting reflex when activated by substance P. Rolapitant has been shown to inhibit both acute and delayed nausea and vomiting associated with cancer chemotherapy and surgical procedures, and appears to act synergistically with serotonin type 3 (5-HT3) receptor blockers. Because of its delayed half-life, rolapitant is particularly potent in preventing delayed (&#x0003e;24 hours after chemotherapy) nausea and vomiting. Rolapitant was approved for use in the United States in 2015 and current indications are in combination with other antiemetic agents in adults for prevention of delayed chemotherapy associated nausea and vomiting. Rolapitant is available as tablets of 90 mg under the brand name Varubi. The typical adult oral dose is 90 mg on day one of each emetogenic chemotherapy cycle, generally in combination with a 5-HT3 receptor blocker and dexamethasone. It has been used off label to treat postoperative nausea and vomiting. Side effects are uncommon, but can include anorexia, headache, neutropenia and dizziness.</p>

        <sec id="Rolapitant.Hepatotoxicity">
          <title>Hepatotoxicity</title>
          <p>Serum aminotransferase elevations following initial cycles of chemotherapy occurred in &#x0003c;2% of rolapitant treated patients and a similar proportion of controls (1.3% vs 1.4% for AST). The aminotransferase elevations were transient, mild-to-moderate in severity, and not associated with symptoms or jaundice. There was no increase in frequency of serum enzyme elevations with subsequent chemotherapy cycles. No cases of clinically apparent liver injury attributable to rolapitant were described in the preregistration clinical trials of this agent and there have been no cases published in the literature since its approval and more widescale use. Thus, significant liver injury from rolapitant must be rare, if it occurs at all.</p>
          <p>Likelihood score: E (unlikely cause of clinically apparent liver injury).</p>
        </sec>
        <sec id="Rolapitant.Mechanism_of_Injury">
          <title>Mechanism of Injury</title>
          <p>Rolapitant is metabolized by and inhibits hepatic CYP 2D6 and is a substrate of CYP 3A4 and thus has the potential to cause significant drug-drug interactions. The mechanism by which rolapitant might cause liver injury is unknown. Rolapitant is generally given as a single, somewhat low oral dose which may account for why it is not associated with significant liver injury.</p>
