          <title>Introduction</title>
          <p>Dimethyl fumarate is an antiinflammatory and immunomodulatory agent that is used to treat relapsing multiple sclerosis. Dimethyl fumarate is associated with a low rate of transient serum enzyme elevations during treatment, but has not been linked to instances of clinically apparent liver injury with jaundice.</p>

          <title>Background</title>
          <p>Dimethyl fumarate (dye meth' il fue' ma rate) is a methylated, unsaturated dicarboxylic acid which has distinctive antiinflammatory and immunomodulatory activities, both in vitro and in vivo. Its mechanism of action is believed to be via activation of the nuclear factor E2-related factor (Nrf2) pathway, which is important in modulating inflammatory cytokines and inducing antioxidant responses. Dimethyl fumarate and other fumarate esters have been used with promising results in psoriasis, sarcoidosis, alopecia areata and multiple sclerosis. In several large, randomized controlled trials, methyl fumarate (BG-12) was shown to reduce relapse rates and improve neuroradiologic outcomes in adult patients with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis. Methyl fumarate was approved for use in relapsing multiple sclerosis in the United States in 2013 and is now available in delayed release capsules of 120 and 240 mg under the brand name Tecfidera. The recommended dose is 120 mg twice daily for 7 days, followed by a maintenance dose of 240 mg twice daily. Common side effects are flushing (25% to 50%), gastrointestinal symptoms of nausea, diarrhea or abdominal pain (10% to 60%), dizziness, erythema (5%) and skin rash (9%).</p>

        <sec id="DimethylFumarate.Hepatotoxicity">
          <title>Hepatotoxicity</title>
          <p>In large randomized controlled trials of dimethyl fumarate in patients with psoriasis and multiple sclerosis, serum ALT elevations were frequent, occurring in up to 25% of patients. The elevations, however, were generally mild-to-moderate and resolved rapidly even without dose modification. Elevations above 3 times ULN were reported in 6% of dimethyl fumarate compared to 3% to 6% of placebo recipients. The enzyme elevations were usually transient and not associated with symptoms or jaundice, requiring drug discontinuation in less than 1% of patients. No cases of acute hepatitis or clinically apparent liver injury were reported in the preregistration trials of methyl fumarate. Despite this, several cases of clinically apparent liver injury with jaundice were reported within 2-3 years of its approval and more wide scale use. Most cases occurred within 2 to 3 months of starting dimethyl fumarate but instances with more prolonged latency were reported. The typical case presented with acute hepatitis like features, marked increases in serum aminotransferase levels, and only modest alkaline phosphatase elevations. Immunoallergic features and autoantibodies were not frequent and all patients recovered upon stopping the medication with no reported instances of chronic injury or hepatic failure.</p>
          <p>Likelihood score: C (probable rare cause of clinically apparent liver injury).</p>

        <sec id="DimethylFumarate.Mechanism_of_Injury">
          <title>Mechanism of Injury</title>
          <p>The mechanism by which dimethyl fumarate causes liver injury is not known but is likely to be idiosyncratic. It is extensively metabolized by serum and tissue esterases to monomethyl fumarate, which is further metabolized in the liver to fumarate which enters the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle. Dimethyl fumarate metabolism is independent of the cytochrome P450 system.</p>

          <title>Outcome and Management</title>
          <p>While chronic therapy with dimethyl fumarate can be associated with mild-to-moderate serum aminotransferase elevations, it has been linked only rarely to cases of clinically apparent liver injury. There is no reason to suspect that there is cross sensitivity of the hepatic injury from dimethyl fumarate with other agents used to treat multiple sclerosis.</p>

          <title>Case 1. Acute hepatitis arising after 4 weeks of dimethyl fumarate therapy.</title>
          <p>[Modified from: J&#x000fc;ngst C, Kim YJ, Lammert F. Severe drug-induced liver injury related to therapy with dimethyl fumarate. Hepatology 2016; 64: 1367-9. <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27228386">PubMed Citation</ext-link>]</p>
          <p>A 26 year old woman with multiple sclerosis was found to have de novo elevations in serum aminotransferase levels (ALT 284 U/L) 4 weeks after starting dimethyl fumarate (120 mg twice daily). The drug was stopped, but over the next 4 weeks she developed fatigue, nausea, abdominal pain and dark urine followed by jaundice. She had no history of liver disease, alcohol abuse or risk factors for viral hepatitis and was not taking other medications. On examination, she was jaundiced, but had no rash, fever or signs of hepatic failure. Serum bilirubin was 9.0 mg/dL, ALT 1256 U/L, alkaline phosphatase 133 U/L and INR 1.58. Other causes of acute liver injury were excluded. Tests for hepatitis A, B, C and E were negative as were autoantibodies. Imaging of the liver showed no evidence of biliary obstruction. A liver biopsy showed acute hepatitis with bridging necrosis. There was bile duct injury but no duct loss, hepatic steatosis or fibrosis. During the next month, symptoms resolved and liver tests decreased towards the normal range. When seen a year later all blood tests were normal and she was being managed on glatiramer acetate.</p>

            <title>Comment</title>
            <p>This patient was found to have serum enzyme elevations four weeks after starting dimethyl fumarate. The aminotransferase were approximately 8 times the upper limit of normal and had been normal when tested before starting the multiple sclerosis agent. The drug was promptly discontinued, but the patient went on to develop clinical symptoms and jaundice and four weeks later had biochemical and histological features of an acute hepatitis. She was symptomatic for several weeks, but ultimately recovered without specific therapy. This was the initial report of clinically apparent liver injury due to dimethyl fumarate which had been associated with a modest rate of serum enzyme elevations during registration trials. This patient was fortunate to have had the drug stopped promptly; a delay may have led to a more severe and consequential course. Most instances of liver injury associated with dimethyl fumarate have arisen during the first 1 to 2 months of therapy and routine monitoring, as was done for this patient, is not unreasonable.</p>
