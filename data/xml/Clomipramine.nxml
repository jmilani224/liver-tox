          <title>Introduction</title>
          <p>Clomipramine is a tricyclic antidepressant used in the therapy of obsessive-compulsive disorder. Clomipramine can cause mild and transient serum enzyme elevations and is rare cause of clinically apparent acute liver injury.</p>
        </sec>
        <sec id="Clomipramine.Background">
          <title>Background</title>
          <p>Clomipramine (kloe mip' ra meen) is a dibenzazepine derived tricyclic antidepressant which acts by inhibition of serotonin reuptake within synaptic clefts in the central nervous system, thus increasing brain serotonin levels. Clomipramine also has some blocking activity at postsynaptic dopamine receptors. Clomipramine is used in the therapy of obsessive-compulsive disorder and was approved for this indication in the United States in 1989. Clomipramine is available in generic forms and under the brand names of Anafranil in capsules of 25, 50 and 75 mg. The typical recommended dose for obsessive compulsive disorder is 25 mg daily, increasing to at least 100 mg daily with a maximum dose of 250 mg daily. Common side effects include dizziness, headache, insomnia, somnolence, gastrointestinal upset, increased appetite, weight gain, blurred vision, dry mouth and urinary retention. Rare, but potentially severe adverse events include suicidal ideation and behavior, worsening of depresssion or mania, glaucoma, serotonin syndrome, hypersensitivity reactions and seizures.</p>
        </sec>
        <sec id="Clomipramine.Hepatotoxicity">
          <title>Hepatotoxicity</title>
          <p>Liver test abnormalities have been reported to occur in up to 16% of patients being treated with tricyclic antidepressants, but elevations are uncommonly above 3 times the upper limit of normal. Serum aminotransferase elevations during clomipramine therapy are reported in 1% to 3% of patients and the abnormalities were usually mild, asymptomatic and transient, reversing even with continuation of medication. As with many tricyclic antidepressants, rare instances of clinically apparent acute liver injury have been reported in patients taking clomipramine. The clinical features of cases of drug induced liver disease from clomipramine have not been well defined. The acute liver injury caused by tricyclic antidepressants typically arises within 1 to 4 weeks of starting the medication and presents with fatigue followed by dark urine and jaundice. Both hepatocellular and cholestatic patterns of injury have been described. The injury is usually mild-to-moderate in severity and recovery is rapid when the tricyclic is discontinued. Immunoallergic features such as rash, fever and eosinophilia are not common and autoantibodies are generally not detected. Fatal cases are extremely rare.</p>
          <p>Likelihood score: D (possible rare cause of clinically apparent liver injury).</p>
        </sec>
        <sec id="Clomipramine.Mechanism_of_Injury">
          <title>Mechanism of Injury</title>
          <p>The mechanism by which clomipramine causes serum aminotransferase elevation is not known. It undergoes extensive hepatic metabolism and a possible cause of liver injury is production of a toxic intermediate of metabolism that may be directly toxic or may induce a hypersensitivity reaction.</p>
        </sec>
        <sec id="Clomipramine.Outcome_and_Management">
          <title>Outcome and Management</title>
          <p>The serum aminotransferase elevations that occur on clomipramine therapy are usually self-limited and do not require dose modification or discontinuation of therapy. The acute liver injury caused by clomipramine is typically self-limited and benign. Results of rechallenge after acute liver injury from clomipramine has not been reported, but rechallenge with tricyclic antidepressants usually causes a prompt recurrence of the liver injury that can be severe and therefore should be avoided. Patients with clinically apparent clomipramine induced liver injury can have cross sensitivity to other tricyclic antidepressants, but should be able to tolerate other antidepressants, the phenothiazines and atypical antipsychotics.</p>
