          <title>Introduction</title>
          <p>Ceritinib is a small molecule tyrosine kinase receptor inhibitor and antineoplastic agent that is used in the therapy of selected forms of advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Ceritinib is associated with a moderate rate of serum aminotransferase elevations during therapy and rare instances of clinically apparent acute liver injury.</p>
        </sec>
        <sec id="Ceritinib.Background">
          <title>Background</title>
          <p>Ceritinib (se ri' ti nib) is a small molecule tyrosine kinase receptor inhibitor with potent activity against anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) that is rearranged and mutated in selected cancers including approximately 5% of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). The mutated, rearranged ALK promotes unregulated cell growth and proliferation and is overexpressed in some cancer cells. Ceritinib has been found to inhibit mutated ALK in cell culture and in several clinical trials was found to induce objective responses in a proportion of patients with advanced ALK-positive NSCLC. Ceritinib received accelerated approval for use crizotinib-refractory, ALK-positive NSCLC in the United States in 2014. Ceritinib is available in capsules of 150 mg under the brand name Zykadia. The recommended initial dose is 750 mg (5 capsules) once daily, continued until progressive disease or intolerable toxicity occurs. Side effects are common and include diarrhea, nausea and vomiting, abdominal pain, fatigue, anorexia and constipation. Uncommon, but potentially severe side effects include severe diarrhea leading to dehydration and renal failure, interstitial lung disease, prolongation of the QTc interval, bradycardia, hyperglycemia, and embryo-fetal toxicity.</p>
        </sec>
        <sec id="Ceritinib.Hepatotoxicity">
          <title>Hepatotoxicity</title>
          <p>Elevations in serum aminotransferase levels are common during ceritinib therapy occurring in 20% to 50% of patients, but rising above 5 times the upper limit of the normal range in only 1% to 2%. Hepatic failure is said to have occurred in 0.2% of patients and to have resulted in several fatalities. Hepatotoxicity appears to be a class effect among ALK inhibitors, although liver injury appears to be more frequent and more severe with crizotinib than ceritinib or alectinib. Specific details of the liver injury associated with ceritinib such as latency, serum enzyme pattern, clinical features and course, have not been published. Other ALK inhibitors typically cause liver injury arising within days or weeks of starting therapy, and presenting abruptly with hepatocellular enzyme elevations and a moderate-to-severe course. Immunoallergic and autoimmune features are not common. The rate of clinically significant liver injury and hepatic failure is increased in patients with preexisting cirrhosis or hepatic impairment due to liver tumor burden. Recurrence upon reexposure has been reported.</p>
          <p>Likelihood score: D (possible cause of clinically apparent liver injury).</p>
        </sec>
        <sec id="Ceritinib.Mechanism_of_Injury">
          <title>Mechanism of Injury</title>
          <p>The latency until onset and the recurrence of injury with reexposure suggests that the clinically apparent liver injury attributed to ALK inhibitors is immunologically mediated. In contrast, the transient serum enzyme elevations that are not uncommon during therapy suggest a direct, intrinsic hepatotoxicity, perhaps caused by off-target inhibition of critical tyrosine kinase receptors in hepatocytes. Ceritinib is metabolized in the liver largely by the cytochrome P450 system (largely CYP 3A) and is susceptible to drug-drug interactions with inhibitors or inducers of CYP 3A.</p>
        </sec>
        <sec id="Ceritinib.Outcome_and_Management">
          <title>Outcome and Management</title>
          <p>Liver injury due to ceritinib varies in severity from minor, transient serum enzyme elevations to acute symptomatic hepatitis and acute liver failure. Serum aminotransferase elevations above 5 times the upper limit of normal (if confirmed) should lead to temporary discontinuation, which should be permanent if laboratory values do not improve significantly or resolve within a few weeks or if symptoms or jaundice arise. Restarting therapy is usually, but not always followed by recurrence of the serum enzyme elevations. There does not appear to be cross reactivity with other tyrosine kinase receptor inhibitors and, in some situations, switching to another protein kinase inhibitor may be appropriate.</p>
