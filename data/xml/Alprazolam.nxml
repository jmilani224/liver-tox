          <title>Introduction</title>
          <p>Alprazolam is an orally available benzodiazepine used predominantly for therapy of anxiety. As with most benzodiazepines, alprazolam therapy has not been associated with serum aminotransferase or alkaline phosphatase elevations, and clinically apparent liver injury from alprazolam has been reported, but is very rare.</p>
        </sec>
        <sec id="Alprazolam.Background">
          <title>Background</title>
          <p>Alprazolam (al pra' zoe lam) is a benzodiazepine that is widely used in the therapy of anxiety and panic disorder. The antianxiety (anxiolytic) activity of the benzodiazepines is mediated by their ability to enhance gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) mediated inhibition of synaptic transmission through binding to the GABA A receptor. Alprazolam was approved in the United States in 1981, and currently more than 40 million prescriptions are filled yearly. Current indications are for anxiety and panic disorders. Alprazolam is available in multiple generic forms and under several brand names such as Xanax or Niravam in tablets of 0.25, 0.5, 1 and 2 mg, as well as in orally disintegrating tablets in similar concentrations and as an oral solution [1 mg/mL] for pediatric use. Extended release forms are available in tablets of 0.5, 1, 2 and 3 mg. The recommended initial dose for adults is 0.5 mg three times daily, increasing as needed to a maximum dose of 4 mg daily in divided doses. Higher doses are used for panic disorder. The most common side effects of alprazolam are dose related and include drowsiness, lethargy, ataxia, dysarthria and dizziness. Tolerance develops to these side effects, but tolerance may also develop to the anxiolytic effects.</p>

        <sec id="Alprazolam.Hepatotoxicity">
          <title>Hepatotoxicity</title>
          <p>Alprazolam, like other benzodiazepines, is rarely associated with serum ALT elevations, and clinically apparent liver injury from alprazolam is extremely rare. There have been a few case reports of acute liver injury from alprazolam and recurrence on reexposure has been reported. In alprazolam related cases of acute liver injury, the latency has been within a few weeks and the typical pattern of liver enzyme elevations has been cholestatic or mixed (Case 1). The injury is usually mild-to-moderate in severity and self-limited. Fever and rash have not been described nor has autoantibody formation.</p>
          <p>Likelihood score: D (possible rare cause of clinically apparent liver injury).</p>
        </sec>
        <sec id="Alprazolam.Mechanism_of_Injury">
          <title>Mechanism of Injury</title>
          <p>Alprazolam is metabolized by the liver via the cytochrome P450 system, predominantly by CYP 3A4. Concurrent use of CYP 3A4 inhibitors, such as cimetidine or ketaconazole, can cause an increase in alprazolam plasma levels. The liver injury from the benzodiazepines is probably due to a rarely produced intermediate metabolite.</p>
        </sec>
        <sec id="Alprazolam.Outcome_and_Management">
          <title>Outcome and Management</title>
          <p>The case reports of hepatic injury due to benzodiazepines were followed by prompt and complete recovery upon stopping the medication, without evidence of residual or chronic injury. No cases of acute liver failure or chronic liver injury due to alprazolam have been described. There is little information about cross reactivity with other benzodiazepines, but some degree of cross sensitivity should be assumed and patients with clinically apparent liver injury due to alprazolam should be monitored if they are switched to related agents.</p>

          <bold>Case 1. Mild acute liver injury due to alprazolam.</bold>
        </p>
        <p>[Modified from: Judd FK, Norman TR, Marriott PF, Burrows GD. A case of alprazolam-related hepatitis. Am J Psychiatry 1986; 143: 388-9. <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2869702">PubMed Citation</ext-link>]</p>
        <p>A 32 year old woman with a long history of panic attacks developed fatigue and abdominal pain 2 weeks after starting alprazolam (1 mg daily increasing to 8 mg daily), and she became jaundiced one week later. She had no history of liver disease and was known to have had normal serum liver tests before starting alprazolam. On examination, she was jaundiced but had no fever or rash. Laboratory results showed elevations in serum enzymes and bilirubin (Table). Tests for hepatitis A and B and for mononucleosis were negative. Alprazolam was stopped and diazepam (which she had received in the past) substituted. She improved rapidly and all tests were normal when she was seen one month after stopping alprazolam.</p>

          <p>A convincing case of alprazolam induced liver injury characterized by a mild cholestatic hepatitis arising 2 to 3 weeks after starting the medication and resolving rapidly with stopping. There were no signs of hypersensitivity. Interestingly, she tolerated other benzodiazepines without problems, indicating lack of cross sensitivity to the injury.</p>
