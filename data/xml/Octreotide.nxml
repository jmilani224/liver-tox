          <title>Introduction</title>
          <p>Octreotide is a synthetic somatostatin analogue that resembles the native polypeptide in its activity in suppressing levels and activity of growth hormone, insulin, glucagon and many other gastrointestinal peptides. Because its half-life is longer than somatostatin, octreotide can be used clinically to treat neuroendocrine tumors that secrete excessive amounts of growth hormone (acromegaly) or other active hormones or neuropeptides. Octreotide has many side effects including suppression of gall bladder contractility and bile production, and maintenance therapy can cause cholelithiasis, pancreatitis as well as clinically apparent liver injury.</p>

        <sec id="Octreotide.Background">
          <title>Background</title>
          <p>Octreotide (ok tree' oh tide) is a synthetic cyclic octapeptide and analogue of somatostatin that is used for its ability to suppress levels and activities of other hormones (growth hormone, insulin, gastrin, secretin, glucagon) or active neuropeptides (serotonin, vasoactive intestinal polypeptide [VIP]). Natural somatostatin is produced in the hypothalamus and acts to suppress growth hormone release from the pituitary. Somatostatin is also found in other neurons throughout the body and particularly in intestinal and pancreatic neurons, where it is active in suppressing release of other hormones and neuropeptides such as insulin, glucagon, gastrin, secretin, motilin, VIP, serotonin and cholecystokinin. Octreotide has a longer half-life (1 to 2 hours) than somatostatin (~3 minutes) and yields effective suppression of hormone production when given three times daily. More recently, longer acting formulations of octreotide have been developed that can be administered weekly or monthly. Octreotide appears to interact largely with the somatostatin subtype 2 and possibly subtype 5 receptors, with little effect on subtypes 1, 3 and 4, explaining its focused effects. Octreotide therapy has been shown to improve symptoms and complications of several neuroendocrine tumors including abnormal growth in acromegaly due to growth hormone secreting pituitary tumors, diarrhea due to VIP secreting intestinal tumors and flushing due to carcinoid tumors. Octreotide was approved for use in the United States in 1988 and current listed indications include acromegaly, watery diarrhea from VIP producing tumors and diarrhea and flushing due to metastatic carcinoid tumors. Octreotide has been used off-label for portal hypertension to control variceal hemorrhage as well as for dumping syndrome and other gastrointestinal motility disorders. Octreotide is available generically and under the brand name Sandostatin in several forms for intravenous or subcutaneous administration. A long acting form is available that can be given monthly (Sandostatin LAR Depot). The typical dose in adults is 100 mcg given as injections three times daily in 2 weeks courses, and then for long term maintenace as injections 2 to 4 times daily or less frequently with long acting formulations. Side effects are common. Adverse events from single injections include influenza-like symptoms of fatigue, headache, nausea and vomiting and local infusion reactions. With continued therapy, adverse events can include diarrhea, abdominal pain, back pain, headache, dizziness, hypothyroidism, hypo- and hyperglycemia, arrhythmias and gall bladder disease.</p>

        <sec id="Octreotide.Hepatotoxicity">
          <title>Hepatotoxicity</title>
          <p>Mild, transient, asymptomatic elevations in serum aminotransferase levels occur in a small proportion of patients receiving octreotide, and in some individuals the elevations are persistent and worsen over time and may require drug discontinuation. In addition, several instances of acute, clinically apparent liver injury attributable to octreotide have been described. The onset is generally within 1 to 6 months of starting therapy and injury may be more frequent with higher doses. Most cases of liver injury associated with octreotide therapy have been asymptomatic and anicteric, and marked by prominent elevations in serum ALT and AST with normal or near normal serum alkaline phosphatase, GGT and bilirubin. In some instances, however, jaundice has arisen, particularly with rechallenge. There have been no instances of acute liver failure or vanishing bile duct syndrome associated with octreotide, and a characteristic feature of the injury is the rapidity of improvement upon stopping the injections or infusions. Several instances of marked aminotransferase elevations with rapid improvements on stopping have been reported in newborns and infants with congenital hyperinsulinemia who were treated with continuous infusions of high doses of octreotide.</p>
          <p>Octreotide causes inhibition of gall bladder contractility and decrease in bile secretion, and long term therapy is associated with a high rate of cholesterol gallstone formation. In prospective studies, between 25% and 65% of patients with acromegaly treated with maintenance octreotide developed gallstones detected by ultrasonography and a proportion developed symptomatic cholelithiasis requiring hospitalization and cholecystectomy. Even after cholecystectomy, cholesterol stones may form in the common bile duct and intrahepatic ducts causing symptoms, episodes of sepsis and need for partial hepatic resection. Therapy with ursodiol does not appear to prevent gallstone formation during octreotide therapy, although it may help. Octreotide has also been associated with acute pancreatitis, which may be due to its inhibitory effect on gastrointestinal hormone release, although other cases may be secondary to passage of gall bladder stones and pancreatic duct obstruction.</p>
          <p>Likelihood score: C (probable cause of clinically apparent liver injury).</p>
        </sec>
        <sec id="Octreotide.Mechanism_of_Injury">
          <title>Mechanism of Injury</title>
          <p>Octreotide, like somatostatin, decreases cholecystokinin secretion, gall bladder contractility and bile secretion, perhaps accounting for the high rate of gall bladder sludge and stone formation with long term use. How infusions of octreotide cause acute liver injury independent of its effect on bile flow and gall bladder function is uncertain. Octreotide is a polypeptide and, as such, should not have direct or even indirect hepatic toxicity. Thus, the liver injury, like the gall bladder effects, is likely caused by what octreotide does, rather than by its chemical structure or what it is. Octreotide has multiple effects on gastrointestinal motility and changes bowel transient, bacterial composition in the intestines and bile acid levels. In addition, glycogenosis caused by changes in insulin and glucagon is a possible cause of the serum ALT and AST elevations that occur with high doses of octreotide and would account for the rapidity of improvement upon stopping.</p>
        </sec>
        <sec id="Octreotide.Outcome_and_Management">
          <title>Outcome and Management</title>
          <p>The liver injury due to the octreotide generally resolves rapidly with stopping therapy. It also usually recurs upon restarting and may be more severe. For these reasons, patients that are restarted on treatment after an episode of liver injury should be monitored carefully for possible recurrence.</p>
