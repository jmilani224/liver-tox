          <title>Introduction</title>
          <p>Lovastatin is a commonly used cholesterol lowering agent (statin) that is associated with mild, asymptomatic and self-limited serum aminotransferase elevations during therapy and rarely with clinically apparent acute liver injury.</p>
        </sec>
        <sec id="Lovastatin.Background">
          <title>Background</title>
          <p>Lovastatin (loe" va stat' in) is an orally available inhibitor of hepatic 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase, the major rate-limiting enzyme in cholesterol synthesis. Like other members of its class (the &#x0201c;statins&#x0201d;), lovastatin lowers total serum cholesterol and low density lipoprotein (LDL) concentrations, thereby reducing the risk of atherosclerosis and its complications &#x02013; myocardial infarction and stroke. Lovastatin is indicated for treatment of hypercholesterolemia in persons at high risk for coronary, cerebrovascular and peripheral artery disease. Lovastatin is available in tablets of 10, 20, 40 and 60 mg in generic forms and under the brand name Mevacor. Extended release forms (Altoprev) and fixed combinations with niacin (Advicor) are also available. The recommended adult dose is 10 to 80 mg daily in single or two divided doses based upon tolerability and lipid levels. Lovastatin was approved for use in the United States in 1987, the first of this class of drugs to be commercially available. Lovastatin is a widely prescribed drug with more than 7 million prescriptions filled yearly. Common side effects include muscle cramps, joint aches, headache and weakness.</p>

        <sec id="Lovastatin.Hepatotoxicity">
          <title>Hepatotoxicity</title>
          <p>Lovastatin therapy is associated with mild, asymptomatic and usually transient serum aminotransferase elevations. In summary analyses of large scale studies with prospective monitoring, ALT elevations above normal occurred in 3 to 5% of patients, but were above 3 times the upper limit of normal (ULN) in only 0.4% compared to 0.1% of placebo recipients. These elevations were more common with higher doses of lovastatin, being greater than 3 times ULN in 0.1% of patients receiving 20 mg daily, 0.9% with 40 mg and 1.5% with 80 mg daily. Most of these elevations were self-limited and did not require dose modification, although discontinuation is recommended for any elevation above 10 times and for persistent elevations above 5 times the ULN. Lovastatin is also associated with frank, clinically apparent hepatic injury, but cases are rare. The onset of clinical injury ranges from a few weeks to several years. The pattern of injury is typically cholestatic, but can be hepatocellular. Rash, fever and eosinophilia are uncommon as are autoimmune features. The injury usually resolves rapidly upon stopping lovastatin, but instances of prolonged cholestasis have been reported (Case 1).</p>
          <p>The traditional Chinese medication known as red yeast rice which is used to treat hyperlipidemia has been shown to contain monacolin K, a natural component that is chemically identical to lovastatin, perhaps explaining its efficacy in reducing cholesterol levels. Red yeast rice has also been implicated in cases of acute liver injury and myopathies that are similar to those linked to lovastatin. In some instances cross-sensitivity to hepatic injury has been shown between red yeast rice products and lovastatin.</p>
          <p>Likelihood score: B (likely cause of clinically apparent liver injury).</p>
        </sec>
        <sec id="Lovastatin.Mechanism_of_Injury">
          <title>Mechanism of Injury</title>
          <p>The cause of hepatic injury from lovastatin is unknown. Lovastatin is largely metabolized in the liver (via CYP 3A4) and metabolites are excreted in bile. The mild, self-limited ALT elevations are likely due to a toxic intermediate of drug metabolism and the reversal of these elevations due to adaptation. The idiosyncratic, clinically apparent liver injury associated with lovastatin may be due to failure of adaptation.</p>
        </sec>
        <sec id="Lovastatin.Outcome_and_Management">
          <title>Outcome and Management</title>
          <p>The ALT elevations that occur with lovastatin therapy often resolve spontaneously within a few weeks without discontinuation. The product label for lovastatin mentions rare cases of acute liver failure due to lovastatin, some of which were fatal. There have not been fatal instances of acute liver injury attributable to lovastatin in the published literature. In the average case, recovery is expected within 1 to 2 months of stopping lovastatin, but instances of prolonged cholestasis and some degree of vanishing bile duct syndrome have been reported. In view of the wide scale use of lovastatin, clinically apparent and severe liver injury is extraordinarily rare. Recurrence of injury with rechallenge has been reported and should be avoided. Switching therapy to another statin after lovastatin induced injury is apparently safe, but few instances have been reported, and it should be done with careful monitoring for recurrence.</p>

          <title>Case 1. Cholestatic hepatitis due to lovastatin therapy.</title>
          <p>[Modified from: McQueen MJ. Cholestatic jaundice associated with lovastatin (Mevacor) therapy. Can Med Assoc J 1990; 142: 841-2.]</p>
          <p>A 40 year old man developed fatigue, dark urine, jaundice and itching approximately 11 weeks after starting lovastatin (20 mg daily). He had no previous history of liver disease and drank little alcohol. He had a past history of kidney stones, hyperlipidemia and hypertension, and his other medications included allopurinol (100 mg daily) and the combination of hydrochlorothiazide and amiloride. Liver tests had been normal in the past. When he was finally seen and evaluated, 17 weeks after starting therapy, laboratory tests showed a mixed pattern of serum enzyme elevations. Tests for hepatitis A and B and for autoantibodies were negative. An ultrasound of the abdomen showed evidence suggestive of bile duct dilatation, but ERCP was normal. Lovastatin was stopped and he improved symptomatically. Liver tests had improved but were not completely normal six months later.</p>
