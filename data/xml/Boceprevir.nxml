          <title>Introduction</title>
          <p>Boceprevir is an oral, direct acting hepatitis C virus (HCV) protease inhibitor that is used in combination with other antiviral agents in the treatment of chronic hepatitis C, genotype 1. Boceprevir has not been linked to instances of acute liver injury during therapy but, when combined with peginterferon and ribavirin, has been associated with cases of hepatic decompensation in patients with preexisting cirrhosis.</p>
        </sec>
        <sec id="Boceprevir.Background">
          <title>Background</title>
          <p>The hepatitis C virus is a small RNA virus that is a major cause of chronic hepatitis, cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma in the United States as well as worldwide. Various approaches to antiviral therapy of chronic hepatitis C have been developed, starting in the 1980s with interferon alfa which was replaced in the 1990s by long acting forms of interferon (peginterferon) to which was added the oral nucleoside analogue, ribavirin. Between 2010 and 2015, several potent oral, direct acting anti-HCV agents were developed and combinations of these found to have marked activity against the virus, allowing for highly effective therapy without use of interferon with treatment courses of 12 to 24 weeks only. These direct acting agents included HCV protease (NS3/4) inhibitors, structural replication complex (NS5A) inhibitors and the HCV RNA polymerase (NS5B) inhibitors. The HCV protease inhibitors block the activity of the viral encoded protease that is essential in the posttranslational modification of the viral polypeptide, cleaving it into a series of structural and nonstructural (NS: enzyme) regions. The HCV proteases that have been developed are polypeptide-like molecules, modified amino acids that that resemble the specific amino acid sequence that the protease cleaves and act as competitive inhibitors of the protease enzyme. At least four HCV protease inhibitors (all having the suffix: -previrs) have been approved for use in the United States: boceprevir [2012], telaprevir [2012], simeprevir [2013], and paritaprevir [2014].</p>
          <p>Boceprevir (boe se' pre vir) was one of the first direct acting agents developed as therapy of hepatitis C. Like other HCV protease inhibitors, boceprevir blocks the activity of the viral encoded protease (HCV nonstructural [NS] region 3/4) that is essential in the posttranslational modification of the viral polypeptide, that is cleaved into a series of structural and nonstructural (enzyme) regions. When used by itself, it results in rapid inhibition of HCV RNA levels, but resistance develops rapidly in a high proportion of patients. When combined with peginterferon and ribavirin, it was shown to provide a sustained inhibition of HCV RNA with a low rate of antiviral resistance. Triple therapy with boceprevir, peginterferon and ribavirin, when given for 44 to 48 weeks, increased the sustained virological response (SVR) rate from 40% to 50% (peginterferon and ribavirin alone) to 65% to 75% in patients with genotype 1. Boceprevir was approved for use in the United States in 2012 for patients with chronic hepatitis C, genotype 1, in combination with peginterferon and ribavirin. Since that time, boceprevir has been largely replaced by more potent and better tolerated oral antiviral agents that can be given without peginterferon, but it is still available under the brand name Victrelis as capsules of 200 mg. The recommended dose is 800 mg three times daily. The side effects of boceprevir are difficult to separate from those of the coadministered peginterferon and ribavirin, but the triple therapy is associated with a higher rate of many side effects, including anemia, fatigue, headache, nausea, itching, rash and neutropenia.</p>

        <sec id="Boceprevir.Hepatotoxicity">
          <title>Hepatotoxicity</title>
          <p>In large randomized controlled trials, triple therapy with boceprevir, peginterferon and ribavirin was associated with a high rate of adverse events that often required dose adjustments and led to early discontinuation in 5% to 20% of patients. However, serum ALT elevations and clinically apparent liver injury were not generally mentioned as adverse events of therapy. The exception to this occurred in patients with preexisting cirrhosis in whom de novo, seemingly spontaneous hepatic decompensation occurred in a proportion of treated subjects. The cause of the decompensation was not clear and the separate role of boceprevir from peginterferon and ribavirin and from what might happen even without therapy could not be easily defined. Nevertheless, in postmarketing studies of triple therapy of chronic hepatitis C with cirrhosis, decompensation was reported in 3% to 8% of patients and deaths from hepatic failure in 1% to 3%.</p>
          <p>Likelihood score: E* (unproven but suspected cause of liver injury).</p>
        </sec>
        <sec id="Boceprevir.Mechanism_of_Injury">
          <title>Mechanism of Injury</title>
          <p>The mechanism by which boceprevir might cause liver injury is not known. It is metabolized in the liver largely via the cytochrome P450 system, predominantly CYP 3A4. It is also a substrate of P-glycoprotein (P-gp). It is susceptible to drug-drug interactions, but largely for those agents that have major effects or are highly dependent upon CYP 3A4 and P-gp for their metabolism. In addition, the other adverse effects of boceprevir, particularly when combined with peginterferon and ribavirin, may predispose to events that might lead to hepatic decompensation in a susceptible patient. Triple therapy is associated with a high rate of anemia, neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, infection, gastrointestinal upset, dehydration and rash, all of which might help precipitate hepatic decompensation in a patient with underlying cirrhosis or advanced fibrosis.</p>
        </sec>
        <sec id="Boceprevir.Outcome_and_Management">
          <title>Outcome and Management</title>
          <p>While triple therapy using boceprevir is currently rarely used, it must be considered inadvisable in patients with preexisting cirrhosis, particularly those with a prior history of hepatic decompensation. A similar high rate of decompensation of preexisting cirrhosis has been reported with triple therapy using telaprevir and simeprevir, two other HCV protease inhibitors. In fact, hepatic decompensation was also a reported complication of all-oral antiviral therapy of hepatitis C, although the rates reported with non-interferon and non-ribavirin containing regimens were quite low (&#x0003c;1%).</p>
