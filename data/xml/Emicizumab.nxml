          <title>Introduction</title>
          <p>Emicizumab is a humanized bispecific monoclonal antibody to two human coagulation factors &#x02013; factor IXa and factor X &#x02013; that mimics the activity of factor VIII and is used to prevent bleeding episodes in patients with severe hemophilia A (which is caused by factor VIII deficiency). Emicizumab has not been linked to serum enzyme elevations during therapy or to instances of idiosyncratic acute liver injury.</p>

        <sec id="Emicizumab.Background">
          <title>Background</title>
          <p>Emicizumab (e" mi ciz' ue mab) is a recombinant, humanized, bispecific monoclonal antibody to two human coagulation factors &#x02013; factor IXa and factor X &#x02013; that is used to prevent bleeding episodes in patients with severe hemophilia A. Hemophilia A is a serious genetic disease associated with deficiency in product of factor VIII leading to recurrent episodes of bleeding that result in major disability and premature death. Hemophilia A is typically treated with infusions of factor VIII isolated and concentrated from human plasma or produced by recombinant techniques. Some patients given factor VIII infusions, however, develop neutralizing antibodies which inhibit the anticoagulation activity of the infusions. Emicizumab is a recombinant bispecific monoclonal antibody that binds to both factor IXa and X, which mimics the co-factor function of factor VIII, bypassing its need in the coagulation cascade. In clinical trials, emicizumab was found to reduce bleeding episodes in patients with hemophilia A and antibodies to factor VIII. Emicizumab was approved for use for this indication in the United States in 2017. Emicizumab is available as a solution in single dose vials of 30, 60, 105 and 150 mg under the commercial name Hemlibra. The recommended dose is 3 mg/kg by subcutaneous injection once weekly for 4 weeks, followed by 1.5 mg/kg weekly. Side effects are not common, but can include headache, arthralgia and infection site reactions. Rare, but potentially severe adverse reactions may include hypersensitivity reactions and thromboembolic events.</p>

        <sec id="Emicizumab.Hepatotoxicity">
          <title>Hepatotoxicity</title>
          <p>In clinical trials of emicizumab in patients with hemophilia A serum enzyme levels were rarely mentioned and laboratory test results were described as being stable or unremarkable. In preregistration studies of emicizumab there were no reports of clinically apparent liver injury with jaundice. There have been no reports of acute liver failure, chronic hepatitis or vanishing bile duct syndrome associated with emicizumab therapy.</p>
          <p>Likelihood score: E (unlikely cause of clinically apparent liver injury).</p>
        </sec>
        <sec id="Emicizumab.Mechanism_of_Liver_Injury">
          <title>Mechanism of Liver Injury</title>
          <p>The mechanism by which emicizumab might cause liver injury is unknown. Emicizumab is a monoclonal antibody and, like other proteins, is metabolized into amino acids and is unlikely to have intrinsic toxicity.</p>
