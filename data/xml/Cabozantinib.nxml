          <title>Introduction</title>
          <p>Cabozantinib is orally available kinase inhibitor and antineoplastic agent that is used in treatment of advanced, metastatic medullary thyroid cancer and refractory renal cell carcinoma. Cabozantinib is associated with a low rate of serum enzyme elevations during treatment and has been implicated with rare instances of clinically apparent, acute liver injury, some of which have been severe.</p>
        </sec>
        <sec id="Cabozantinib.Background">
          <title>Background</title>
          <p>Cabozantinib (ka" boe zan' ti nib) is an orally available, small molecule, multi-kinase inhibitor with activity against hepatocyte growth factor receptor (MET), vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2 (VEGFR-2), and rearranged during transfection (RET), cell surface tyrosine kinase receptors which are overexpressed in several forms of cancer. Cabozantinib has been evaluated as therapy of several forms of advanced and metastatic carcinomas and has shown efficacy in medullary thyroid and renal cell carcinoma. Cabozantinib received accelerated approval for use in the United States in 2012 for therapy of medullary thyroid cancer after failure of other therapies. Indications were expanded in 2016 to include advanced renal cell carcinoma. For therapy of medullary thyroid cancer, cabozantinib is available as capsules of 20 and 80 mg under the brand name Cometriq, and the recommended dose is 140 mg orally once daily. For treatment of advanced renal cell carcinoma, cabozantinib is available as tablets of 20, 40 and 60 mg under the brand name Cabometyx, and the recommended dose is 60 mg orally once daily. Common side effects include diarrhea, fatigue, nausea, constipation, anorexia, weight loss, hand-foot syndrome, stomatitis, hypertension, change in hair color, thrombocytopenia, neutropenia, anemia, rash and fever. Other uncommon, but potentially severe side effects include thrombotic events including myocardial infarction, stroke and arterial thromboses, osteonecrosis of the jaw, posterior leukoencephalopathy and fetal toxicity.</p>
        </sec>
        <sec id="Cabozantinib.Hepatotoxicity">
          <title>Hepatotoxicity</title>
          <p>In large clinical trials of cabozantinib, elevations in serum aminotransferase levels were common, occurring in 16% to 97% of patients. Values greater than 5 times the upper limit of normal (ULN), however, occurred in only 2% to 8% of recipients. Serum alkaline phosphatase elevations were also common and were above 3 times ULN in 3% of patients. Despite the high rate of serum enzyme elevations, cases of clinically apparent liver injury including acute liver failure were not reported in the preregistration trials of cabozantinib. Since the approval of cabozantinib, there have been no published case reports of hepatotoxicity attributed to its use. Serum ALT, AST and alkaline phosphatase elevations are listed as adverse reactions in the product label for cabozantinib, and cholestatic hepatitis is mentioned as a rare occurrence, but monitoring of serum enzymes during treatment is not specifically recommended.</p>
          <p>Likelihood score: E* (Unproven but suspected rare cause of clinically apparent liver injury).</p>
        </sec>
        <sec id="Cabozantinib.Mechanism_of_Injury">
          <title>Mechanism of Injury</title>
          <p>The mechanisms of liver injury accounting for serum enzyme elevations during cabozantinib therapy are not known, but may be a direct effect of inhibition of cellular kinases by this multi-specific tyrosine kinase inhibitor. Cabozantinib is metabolized in the liver, predominantly by the cytochrome P 450 system and especially by CYP 3A4. Cabozantinib is susceptible to drug-drug interactions and the effects of CYP 3A4 inhibitors and inducers.</p>
        </sec>
        <sec id="Cabozantinib.Outcome_and_Management">
          <title>Outcome and Management</title>
          <p>Serum aminotransferase elevations above 5 times the upper limit of normal (if confirmed) should lead to dose reduction or temporary cessation. Clinically apparent liver injury should prompt immediate interruption of cabozantinib therapy. There is little information on cross reactivity in risk for hepatic injury between cabozantinib and other protein kinase inhibitors.</p>
