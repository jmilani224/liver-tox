          <title>Introduction</title>
          <p>Herbalife is weight management and nutritional supplement manufacturer that markets herbal and dietary supplements (HDS) for a wide range of conditions, including weight loss, digestive health, heart health, personal care, energy and fitness, general health, wellbeing, and boosting of energy and immunity. There have been many reports of acute, clinically apparent liver injury in persons taking Herbalife products, but the link to the HDS product has often been controversial. The specific ingredients in the various Herbalife products that might cause liver injury have not been identified.</p>

          <title>Background</title>
          <p>Herbalife is a for-profit, publically traded company (Herbalife International of America, Inc., Torrance CA) that produces an array of multi-ingredient herbal and nutritional supplements (MINS). The products are not sold in conventional stores or nutrition outlets, but by independent distributors or via the internet. The constituents of the various Herbalife products vary but are largely proteins, amino acids, vitamins, minerals and selected botanicals such as aloe vera, green tea, ginseng, gingko, guarana, valerian, lavender, saw palmetto, echinacea, astragalus, ginger, hops, bilberry, vegetable and fruit extracts and many others. The ingredients and their concentrations in some of the products have been modified over time. Some of the more common products sold are listed in the Table below with a partial listing of their ingredients as provided in the product label. Because the products are considered nutritional supplements, they are not subject to the usual efficacy and safety evaluation given to medications. However, all nutritional supplements are subject to rules regarding purity and good manufacturing practices. Nutritional supplements are not recommended for specific medical conditions, but can be advertised as being supportive of general health, wellness and weight reduction. These multiingredient products appear to be generally safe and well tolerated, but prospective studies of their efficacy, tolerance and safety have not been published.</p>

          <title>Hepatotoxicity</title>
          <p>The initial reports of liver injury attributed to Herbalife were from Spain and Israel, with subsequent case series from Latin America, Switzerland, Iceland and the United States. At least 50 instances of clinically apparent liver injury have been described in persons taking Herbalife products. The typical latency has ranged from 1 month to more than a year, the average being 2 to 9 months. The onset is usually insidious with fatigue, nausea, abdominal discomfort, followed by dark urine and jaundice. The pattern of serum enzyme elevations is usually hepatocellular with marked elevations in ALT, but only modest increases in alkaline phosphatase. Occasional cases with a mixed pattern of injury have been described and some cases have been called &#x0201c;cholestatic&#x0201d;, largely on the basis of liver histology rather than serum enzyme elevations. Immunoallergic features and autoimmune markers were not common. Resolution occurred upon withdrawal and several instances of relapse with restarting a Herbalife product have been described, although details of the rechallenge are rarely given, largely because the rechallenge was not intentional but a result of the patient restarting the medication on their own and without medical supervision. Liver histology has been variable, but usually shows acute hepatitis with cholestatic features. At least one instance with changes of sinusoidal obstruction syndrome has been described.</p>
          <p>A major difficulty in assessing cases of liver injury possibly due to a Herbalife product is that most patients are taking more than one preparation (some as many as 12) and each product contains multiple nutritional supplements and botanicals. Some of the products contain green tea and others aloe vera, but the concentrations of these herbals are not always clear and they appear to have decreased in recent years. Because of the many components in these multi-ingredient nutritional supplements, it is difficult to attribute the liver injury to any specific substance listed on the product labels. The components of the products change and green tea is no longer listed as a constituent of the core products. The number of cases of liver injury attributable to Herbalife products appears to have decreased since their introduction.</p>
          <p>Likelihood score: A (well established cause of clinically apparent liver injury).</p>

        <sec id="Herbalife.Mechanism_of_Injury">
          <title>Mechanism of Injury</title>
          <p>The liver injury attributed to Herbalife products remains unexplained. There was no clear commonality in the products themselves, much less their constituents. Some products contained green tea or aloe vera extracts, both which have been implicated in other forms of HDS liver injury.</p>
        </sec>
        <sec id="Herbalife.Outcome_and_Management">
          <title>Outcome and Management</title>
          <p>The liver injury that has been attributed to Herbalife products has usually been mild-to-moderate in severity and self-limited in course, resolving in 1 to 2 months of stopping the preparations. Rare instances of acute liver failure and even progressive fibrosis and cirrhosis have been reported, but are uncommon and not always completely well documented. Nevertheless, in patients presenting with acute or chronic, unexplained liver injury, all HDS products should be discontinued and the case reported to federal registries. It is also helpful to carefully define what products were being taken and at what doses and for how long. Retrieval of the actual product or products can also be helpful as progress is being made in the identification of ingredients by advanced chemical and biochemical methods.</p>

          <p>[Modified from: Chen GC, Ramanathan VS, Law D, Funchain P, Chen GC, French S, Shlopov B, et al. Acute liver injury induced by weight-loss herbal supplements. World J Hepatol 2010; 2: 410-5. <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21173910">PubMed Citation</ext-link>]</p>
          <p>A 37 year old woman developed nausea, epigastric pain and jaundice approximately 2 months after starting several Herbalife dietary supplements for weight loss. The supplements mentioned included Formula One Shake Mix, [Formula Two] Multivitamin Complex, [Formula Three] Cell Activator, Cell-U-loss, Herbal Concentrate Original and Total Control Formula. She had no previous history of liver disease and denied alcohol and drug abuse. On presentation one month after onset of symptoms, she was jaundiced, but had no fever, rash or signs of chronic liver disease. Laboratory tests showed marked elevations in ALT (2068 U/L) and AST (2199 U/L) with minimal increase in alkaline phosphatase (185 U/L) and a total bilirubin of 15.3 mg/dL. She was admitted for evaluation. Tests for hepatitis A, B, C, E, EBV and cytomegalovirus were negative as were routine autoantibodies. Immunoglobulin levels were normal. An abdominal CT scan showed no evidence of biliary obstruction. A liver biopsy showed an acute hepatocellular injury with bridging fibrosis. Once the supplements were stopped, she improved slowly and was discharged one week later without evidence of worsening liver disease, hepatic encephalopathy or hypoglycemia (Table). Subsequently, her symptoms resolved and laboratory tests had returned to normal or near normal levels when she was seen two months later.</p>

            <p>A case of drug induced liver injury in a woman in a weight loss program using multiple Herbalife products. No other possible cause of liver injury was identified. The agent responsible in the numerous dietary supplements that she was taking could not be identified. The injury was distinctly hepatocellular and viral-hepatitis like and resembled the typical injury associated with green tea. She worsened for the first week after stopping the nutritional supplements but improved thereafter, and all tests were normal or near normal two months later.</p>
