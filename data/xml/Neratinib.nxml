          <title>Introduction</title>
          <p>Neratinib is an orally available tyrosine kinase receptor inhibitor that is used in the extended adjuvant therapy of early stage breast cancer. Neratinib is associated with a low rate of transient elevations in serum aminotransferase levels during therapy, but has not been convincingly linked to cases of clinically apparent liver injury with jaundice.</p>
        </sec>
        <sec id="Neratinib.Background">
          <title>Background</title>
          <p>Neratinib (ne ra' ti nib) is a small molecule tyrosine kinase receptor inhibitor with potent activity against human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2 or ErbB2). These tyrosine kinase receptors are often mutated and over expressed in tumor tissue and cause unregulated cell growth and proliferation. This mutation is present in 20% of breast cancers and is particularly overexpressed in early stage cancers. Inhibition of the unregulated receptor can lead to reversal of progression of the cancer, although clinical responses are sometimes limited by the development of tumor resistance caused by further mutations in the receptor gene. In several large controlled trials, adjuvant therapy with neratinib was shown to improve progression free survival in patients with early stage, HER2-positive breast cancer. Neratinib received approval for use in the United States in 2017. Current indications are as extended adjuvant therapy for early stage, HER2-positive breast cancer following trastuzumab treatment. Neratinib is available in tablets of 40 mg under the brand name Nerlynx. The recommended dose is 240 mg (6 tablets) once daily for one year or until intolerable toxicity occurs. Side effects are common and particularly diarrhea [95%], which can be severe and dose limiting and for which prophylaxis with antidiarrheal agents is recommended. Other frequent side effects include nausea, abdominal pain, anorexia, weight loss, abdominal distension, fatigue, rash, stomatitis, dry skin, paronychia, muscle spasms and urinary treat infections. Uncommon, but potentially severe side effects include severe diarrhea leading to dehydration and renal failure, and embryo-fetal toxicity.</p>

        <sec id="Neratinib.Hepatotoxicity">
          <title>Hepatotoxicity</title>
          <p>Elevations in serum aminotransferase levels are not uncommon during neratinib therapy occurring in up to 10% of patients, but rising above 5 times the upper limit of the normal range in only 1% to 2%. In prelicensure studies, there were no instances of neratinib related clinically apparent liver injury and serum enzyme elevations were typically mild and self-limited and not associated with symptoms or jaundice. Hepatotoxicity may be a class effect among protein kinase inhibitors of HER2, although the frequency and severity vary among the different agents. Specific details of the liver injury associated with neratinib such as latency, serum enzyme pattern, clinical features and course, have not been published. Other tyrosine kinase receptor inhibitors typically cause liver injury arising within days or weeks of starting therapy and presenting abruptly with hepatocellular enzyme elevations and a moderate-to-severe course. Immunoallergic and autoimmune features are not common. The rate of clinically significant liver injury and hepatic failure is increased in patients with preexisting cirrhosis or hepatic impairment due to liver tumor burden. Nevertheless, neratinib has not been convincingly linked to instances of clinically apparent liver injury.</p>
          <p>Likelihood score: E* (unproven but suspected cause of clinically apparent liver injury).</p>
        </sec>
        <sec id="Neratinib.Mechanism_of_Injury">
          <title>Mechanism of Injury</title>
          <p>The abrupt and severe nature of the clinically apparent liver injury attributed to EGF receptor inhibitors suggests that it is immunologically mediated. On the other hand, the transient serum enzyme elevations that are not uncommon during therapy suggest a direct, intrinsic hepatotoxicity, perhaps caused by inhibition of critical tyrosine kinase receptors in hepatocytes. Neratinib is metabolized in the liver largely by the cytochrome P450 system and is susceptible to drug-drug interactions with inhibitors or inducers of CYP 3A4.</p>
        </sec>
        <sec id="Neratinib.Outcome_and_Management">
          <title>Outcome and Management</title>
          <p>Liver injury due to neratinib has largely been in the form of asymptomatic, transient serum enzyme elevations. Monitoring of liver tests during neratinib therapy is recommended before treatment, monthly for the first 3 months and every 3 months thereafter or as clinically indicated. Serum aminotransferase elevations above 5 times the upper limit of normal should lead to temporary discontinuation, which should be permanent if laboratory values worsen or do not resolve or improve significantly within a few weeks, or if symptoms or jaundice arises. Restarting therapy is usually, but not always followed by recurrence of the serum enzyme elevations. There does not appear to be cross reactivity with other tyrosine kinase receptor inhibitors and, in some situations, switching to another protein kinase inhibitor may be appropriate.</p>
