          <title>Introduction</title>
          <p>Mercaptopurine (also referred to as 6-mercaptopurine or 6-MP) is a purine analogue that is effective both as an anticancer and an immunosuppressive agent, and is used to treat leukemia and autoimmune diseases as a corticosteroid-sparing agent. Mercaptopurine therapy is associated with a high rate of serum aminotransferase elevations which can be accompanied by jaundice. In addition, mercaptopurine has been linked to instances of clinically apparent acute liver injury and long term therapy to nodular regenerative hyperplasia.</p>

        <sec id="Mercaptopurine.Background">
          <title>Background</title>
          <p>Mercaptopurine (mer kap" toe pure' een) is a purine analogue that acts as an antimetabolite by antagonism of purine metabolism which results in a general inhibition of DNA, RNA and subsequent protein synthesis. Mercaptopurine also has antiinflammatory and immunosuppressive activity, inhibiting the maturation of T cells and blocking delayed hypersensitivity reactions. Mercaptopurine was introduced into use in the 1950s for the therapy of leukemia and lymphoma and was formally approved for use in the United States in 1953. It is still used in therapy of acute lymphocytic leukemia and off-label for autoimmune conditions such as Crohn&#x02019;s disease. Mercaptopurine is available generically and under the brand name of Purinethol as tablets of 50 mg. The usual dose is 1 to 3 mg per kilogram or 50 to 150 mg daily, and it is typically given long term. Common side effects include nausea, abdominal upset, rash, aphthous ulcers and dose related bone marrow suppression.</p>
        </sec>
        <sec id="Mercaptopurine.Hepatotoxicity">
          <title>Hepatotoxicity</title>
          <p>Mercaptopurine has been associated with several forms of hepatotoxicity. Patients receiving mercaptopurine for leukemia often have transient and asymptomatic rises in serum aminotransferase or alkaline phosphatase levels and a proportion of these patients develop jaundice, particularly when it is given in high doses. In case series of patients with autoimmune diseases (such as inflammatory bowel disease) treated with mercaptopurine, up to 30% developed serum aminotransferase elevations and these can be persistent as long as therapy is continued, resolving either with dose reduction or discontinuation. Liver biopsy usually demonstrates steatosis and centrolobular injury with scant inflammation.</p>
          <p>Mercaptopurine can also lead to a distinctive acute, clinically apparent liver injury that usually presents with fatigue and jaundice and a cholestatic or mixed pattern of serum enzyme elevations 1 to 6 months after starting therapy, but sometimes later, particularly following an increase in dose. Serum enzyme levels are often not very high, certainly not in the range that occurs with acute viral hepatiits. Rash, fever and eosinophilia are uncommon and autoantibodies are generally not found. Liver biopsy typically shows a mixed hepatocellular-cholestatic injury with cholestasis, focal hepatocellular necrosis, bile duct injury and variable amounts of inflammation. The injury is idiosyncratic and similar to the cholestatic hepatitis associated with azathioprine. The liver injury usually resolves upon stopping, but prolonged cholestasis has been reported and some cases have been fatal. In large case series and registries, mercaptopurine usually ranks among the top 20 causes of drug induced liver injury, and if combined with cases due to azathioprine [a prodrug of mercaptopurine] would rank among the top 10 more frequent causes.</p>
          <p>Chronic therapy with mercaptopurine and other thiopurines can lead to nodular regeneration and symptomatic portal hypertension. This chronic hepatotoxicity typically presents with fatigue and signs and symptoms of portal hypertension (ascites, varices), with mild liver enzyme abnormalities and minimal jaundice arising 6 months to many years after starting mercaptopurine. Liver biopsy shows nodular regenerative hyperplasia without significant fibrosis and varying amounts of sinusoidal dilation and central vein injury. This syndrome can progress to hepatic failure, particularly if mercaptopurine is continued, but gradual improvement on stopping therapy is typical. Rarely, the onset of this syndrome can be acute with abdominal pain and ascites in which situation liver biopsy usually shows sinusoidal dilation, central congestion and injury to sinusoidal endothelial cells suggestive of veno-occlusive disease, which is currently referred to as sinusoidal obstructive syndrome. Typically, serum aminotransferase levels and alkaline phosphatase levels are minimally elevated, even in the presence of hyperbilirubinemia and other manifestations of hepatic dysfunction and portal hypertension. Many cases present initially with unexplained thrombocytopenia, and progressive decreases in platelet counts may be the most sensitive marker for the development of the non-cirrhotic portal hypertension.</p>
          <p>Finally long-term therapy with mercaptopurine and other thiopurines has been implicated in leading to the development of malignancies, including hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and hepatosplenic T cell lymphoma (HSTCL). Both of these complications are rare but have been reported in several dozen case reports and small case series. In neither instance, has the role of thiopurine therapy in causing the malignacies been proven, and similar cases have been described in patients with autoimmune conditions or after solid organ transplantation who have not received thiopurines. Hepatocellular carcinoma typically arises after years of azathioprine or mercaptopurine therapy and in the absence of accompanying liver disease (although sometimes with focal hepatic glycogenosis). The HCC is most frequently found on an imaging study done of an unrelated condition. The prognosis is more favorable than that of HCC associated with cirrhosis. Hepatosplenic T cell lymphoma has been reported largely among young men with inflammatory bowel disease and long term immunosuppression with a thiopurine with or without anti-tumor necrosis factor therapy. The typical presentation is with fatigue, fever, hepatosplenomegaly and pancytopenia. The diagnosis is made by bone marrow or liver biopsy showing marked infiltration with malignant T cells. HSTCL is poorly responsive to antineoplastic therapy and has a high mortality rate.</p>
          <p>Likelihood score: A (well known cause of clinically apparent liver injury).</p>

        <sec id="Mercaptopurine.Mechanism_of_Injury">
          <title>Mechanism of Injury</title>
          <p>Mercaptopurine is believed to have a direct, dose related hepatotoxic effect and similar types of injury can be reproduced in animal models. The toxic effects of mercaptopurine, and particularly the myelotoxicity, have been linked to higher levels of methyl-mercaptopurine, a product of one of the metabolic pathways of mercaptopurine metabolism. Mercaptopurine undergoes extensive hepatic metabolism to other thiopurines via three different pathways. Patients with low levels or a deficiency in thiopurine methyltransferase, which mediates one of these metabolic pathways, have a higher rate of complications of mercaptopurine use, particularly bone marrow suppression, but may not be at a higher risk for liver injury. The acute cholestatic hepatitis associated with mercaptopurine, on the other hand, is more likely due to idiosyncratic reaction, although it is also more common with higher doses of the thiopurine.</p>
        </sec>
        <sec id="Mercaptopurine.Outcome_and_Management">
          <title>Outcome and Management</title>
          <p>The acute liver injury caused by mercaptopurine usually begins to improve rapidly upon stopping the medication, but instances of progression to hepatic failure despite discontinuation of mercaptopurine have been reported. There are no known specific treatments for mercaptopurine hepatotoxicity. Rechallenge with mercaptopurine usually results in recurrence of the injury (within days to weeks) and should be avoided. Some, but not all, patients have tolerated switching therapy to azathioprine or thioguanine or with use of lower doses in combination with allopurinol. In cases of severe hepatic injury from mercaptopurine, however, substitution with a structurally unrelated antimetabolite or immunosuppressive agent is more appropriate.</p>

          <p>A 45 year old man with membranous glomerulonephritis developed nausea and fatigue followed by jaundice 4 months after adding mercaptopurine (150 to 200 mg/day) to chronic prednisolone therapy. He had no previous history of liver disease, alcohol abuse or risk factors for viral hepatitis. Physical examination revealed jaundice, enlargement of the liver and spleen and peripheral edema. He also had Cushingoid features. Laboratory testing showed total bilirubin of 9.9 mg/dL (direct 5.9 mg/dL), AST 112 and alkaline phosphatase 11.3 Bodansky units (2.5 times ULN). Mercaptopurine was stopped and he improved clinically within a week, while laboratory abnormalities decreased more slowly (Table). Two months later all liver tests were normal.</p>
