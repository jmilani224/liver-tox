          <title>Introduction</title>
          <p>Metaxalone is a centrally acting skeletal muscle relaxant that has been in use for more than 40 years. Metaxalone has not been associated with serum aminotransferase elevations during therapy or with clinically apparent hepatic injury.</p>
        </sec>
        <sec id="Metaxalone.Background">
          <title>Background</title>
          <p>Metaxalone (me tax' a lone) acts centrally as a skeletal muscle relaxant, but its efficacy and precise mechanism of action are not well documented. Metaxalone was approved for use in the United States in 1962 and it remains a widely used muscle relaxant. Current indications include the treatment of pain from acute musculoskeletal conditions and muscle spasms. The recommended dosage is 800 mg orally three to four times daily. Metaxalone is available by prescription only in 400 and 800 mg tablets in generic forms as well as under the commercial name Skelaxin. Sparse data are available regarding metaxalone safety. Side effects are not common, but can include drowsiness, dizziness, headache, nausea, and dry mouth.</p>
        </sec>
        <sec id="Metaxalone.Hepatotoxicity">
          <title>Hepatotoxicity</title>
          <p>According to the product brochure, metaxalone may cause jaundice, although there are no specific case reports of hepatotoxicity from metaxalone in the literature and no prospective trials with routine monitoring of aminotransferase levels. Given its long history, metaxalone appears to be without significant hepatotoxicity.</p>
          <p>Likelihood score: E (Unlikely cause of clinically apparent liver injury).</p>
