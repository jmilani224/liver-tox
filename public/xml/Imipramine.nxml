          <title>Introduction</title>
          <p>Imipramine is a tricyclic antidepressant that continues to be widely used in the therapy of depression. Imipramine can cause mild and transient serum enzyme elevations and is rare cause of clinically apparent acute cholestatic liver injury.</p>
        </sec>
        <sec id="Imipramine.Background">
          <title>Background</title>
          <p>Imipramine (im ip' ra meen) is a dibenzazepine derived tricyclic antidepressant which acts by inhibition of serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake within synaptic clefts in the central nervous system, thus increasing brain levels of these neurotransmitters. Imipramine is indicated for therapy of depression and was approved for this indication in the United States in 1959; it is still widely used, with more than 1 million prescriptions being filled yearly. Imipramine is also used for childhood enuresis. Imipramine is available in generic forms and under the brand names of Tofranil in 10, 25, and 50 mg tablets and as capsules of 75, 100, 125 and 150 mg for nighttime dosing. The typical recommended dose for depression in adults is 75 to 100 mg daily in divided doses, increasing gradually to a maximum of 200 mg daily. Imipramine can also be given as a single nighttime dose. The recommended dose in children (ages 6 years or above) is 25 to 75 mg daily 1 hour before bedtime. Common side effects include dizziness, headache, drowsiness, restlessness, confusion, gastrointestinal upset, increased appetite, weight gain, blurred vision, dry mouth and urinary retention.</p>

        <sec id="Imipramine.Hepatotoxicity">
          <title>Hepatotoxicity</title>
          <p>Liver test abnormalities have been reported to occur in up to 20% of patients on long term therapy with imipramine, but elevations are uncommonly above 3 times the upper limit of normal. The aminotransferase abnormalities are usually mild, asymptomatic and transient, reversing even with continuation of medication. Rare instances of clinically apparent acute liver injury as well as prolonged jaundice have been reported due to imipramine. The onset of jaundice is usually with 1 to 8 weeks of starting therapy. The pattern of enzyme elevations varies from hepatocellular to mixed or cholestatic. Signs and symptoms of hypersensitivity (fever, rash, eosinophilia) are common, but usually not very prominent. Rapid recurrence with rechallenge is common. Autoantibody formation is rare. Rare instances of acute liver failure and death attributed to imipramine have been reported.</p>
          <p>Likelihood score: B (likely rare cause of clinically apparent liver injury).</p>
        </sec>
        <sec id="Imipramine.Mechanism_of_Injury">
          <title>Mechanism of Injury</title>
          <p>The mechanism by which imipramine causes serum aminotransferase elevation is not known. It undergoes extensive hepatic metabolism and a possible cause of liver injury is production of an intermediate of metabolism that triggers a hypersensitivity reaction.</p>
        </sec>
        <sec id="Imipramine.Outcome_and_Management">
          <title>Outcome and Management</title>
          <p>The serum aminotransferase elevations that occur on imipramine therapy are usually self-limited and do not require dose modification or discontinuation of therapy. The acute hepatitis caused by imipramine is typically self-limited and benign, but can be severe and even fatal. Instances of prolonged jaundice compatible with vanishing bile duct syndrome have been reported. Rechallenge with imipramine usually causes a prompt recurrence of the liver injury and should be avoided. While cross reactivity of hepatic injury with other tricyclic antidepressants has rarely been described, switching to another form of antidepressants such as the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors is more prudent and is likely to be safe.</p>
