          <title>Introduction</title>
          <p>Tedizolid is an oxazolidinone antibiotic, similar to linezolid, which has a broad spectrum of activity against gram positive bacteria including methicillin resistant Staphyloccocal aureus (MRSA). Tedizolid has been associated with a low rate of transient serum aminotransferase elevations during therapy, but has not been linked to instances of clinically apparent acute liver injury.</p>
        </sec>
        <sec id="Tedizolid.Background">
          <title>Background</title>
          <p>Tedizolid (te diz' oh lid) is a synthetic, second generation oxazolidinone antibiotic, similar to linezolid, that has broad bactericidal activity against gram positive organisms such as enterococci and staphylococci and most streptococci. Importantly, tedizolid has potent activity against Methicillin resistant strains of Staphyloccocus aureus (MRSA). Tedizolid acts by binding to the 50S subunit of bacterial ribosome, preventing the formation of the functional ribosomal 70S subunit and thereby blocking bacterial protein synthesis. In several randomized controlled trials, tedizolid was found to be similar in efficacy (&#x0201c;non-inferior&#x0201d;) to linezolid as therapy of acute bacterial skin and skin-structure infections. Tedizolid was approved for use in the United States in 2014 and is currently indicated for treatment of skin and skin structure infections caused by susceptible bacteria, including Staphylococcus aureus. Because of its activity against multidrug resistant enterococci and staphylococci, the use of tedizolid is usually reserved for severe infections where methicillin or penicillin resistance is found. Tedizolid is available in tablets of 200 mg under the name Sivextro. It is also available as a powder in single dose vials for reconstitution in solution for intravenous administration. Tedizolid is typically given as a 6 day course of 200 mg once daily, either orally or intravenously. Common minor side effects include nausea, diarrhea, abdominal upset, headache and arthralgias. Rare, but severe side effects that can occur with more prolonged therapy include serotonin syndrome, thrombocytopenia and optic and peripheral neuropathy.</p>
        </sec>
        <sec id="Tedizolid.Hepatotoxicity">
          <title>Hepatotoxicity</title>
          <p>Therapy with tedizolid has been associated with mild and transient elevations in serum aminotransferase and alkaline phosphatase levels in 1% to 4% of patients, although similar rates of elevations occur in patients with infections treated with comparable agents including linezolid. In all instances, the elevations occurred without symptoms or jaundice and resolved with discontinuation of the drug.</p>
          <p>While tedizolid has not been linked to cases of clinically apparent liver disease with jaundice, linezolid, a similar oxazolidinone antibiotic, has been linked to cases of lactic acidosis and systemic injury. This syndrome generally arises after 1 to 8 weeks of therapy and is sometimes associated with evidence of liver injury and jaundice. Lactic acidosis is usually due to dysfunction or loss of hepatic mitochondria, with resulting microvesicular steatosis and disturbed hepatic function (not necessarily accompanied by jaundice or even ALT or alkaline phosphatase elevations). Other serious side effects associated with mitochondrial damage include peripheral and optic neuropathy, pancreatitis, serotonin syndrome and renal injury. The mitochondrial injury is believed to be due to the inhibition of mitochondrial ribosomal function that matches the known effect of the oxazolidinones on bacterial ribosomal function. Lactic acidosis occurs after 1 to 8 weeks of treatment and can be severe, although it resolves rapidly with discontinuation. In contrast, the optic and peripheral neuropathy due to this class of antibiotics resolves more slowly and can be permanent. Lactic acidosis can be fatal, and hepatic dysfunction and jaundice have been mentioned in severe cases attributed to linezolid. This syndrome has yet to be clearly linked to tedizolid therapy.</p>
          <p>Likelihood score: E* (unproven but suspected cause of liver injury).</p>
        </sec>
        <sec id="Tedizolid.Mechanism_of_Injury">
          <title>Mechanism of Injury</title>
          <p>The etiology of serum enzyme elevations during tedizolid therapy is not known and may relate more to the underlying condition rather than injury from tedizolid. Lactic acidosis and peripheral neuropathy from oxazolidinones are probably due to inhibition of mitochondrial ribosomal function and protein synthesis. Indeed, several mitochondrial DNA polymorphisms [2706A&#x0003e;G and 3010G&#x0003e;A] have been identified in patients who developed lactic acidosis while on linezolid that may have represented a genetic predisposition to this adverse event.</p>
        </sec>
        <sec id="Tedizolid.Outcome_and_Management">
          <title>Outcome and Management</title>
          <p>The serum aminotransferase and alkaline phosphatase elevations that occur during tedizolid therapy are self-limited and resolve once therapy is stopped. There are no reports of cross sensitization and hepatic injury from tedizolid in persons with hepatic injury from other antibiotics or sulfonamides. The lactic acidosis due to linezolid has been linked to injury to hepatic mitochondria and with microvesicular steatosis, but is usually rapidly reversed with withdrawal of therapy. Treatment with carnitidine, antioxidants, thiamine and prednisone has been used, but has not been shown to be effective. Use of intravenous 20% glucose infusions, which are effective in treating the lactic acidosis of acute fatty liver of pregnancy, Reye syndrome and fialuridine therapy, has not been studied. However, tedizolid has not been definitely linked to this syndrome.</p>
