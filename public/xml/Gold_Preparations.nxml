          <title>Introduction</title>
          <p>Gold salts, including auranofin and gold sodium thiomalate, have been used for the therapy of rheumatoid arthritis for many decades, but have recently been replaced by more modern disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs. Parenteral gold therapy (chrysotherapy) can cause acute, clinically apparent hepatitis that is usually cholestatic and self-limited in nature, but can be severe and even fatal. In contrast, oral gold preparations (such as auranofin) are associated with a low rate of serum enzyme elevations during treatment, but have not been convincingly linked to clinically apparent liver injury.</p>

        <sec id="Gold_Preparations.Background">
          <title>Background</title>
          <p>Gold given as a conjugate with thioglucose, thiosulphate or thiomalate salt has disease modifying activity in rheumatoid arthritis and can induce remission in up to 50% of patients. The mechanism of action is not well defined, but gold has clear antiinflammatory activity and lowers serum immunoglobulin levels. The use of gold as an antiinflammatory agent arose out of observations by Robert Koch who reported that gold salts had in vitro activity against mycobacterium tuberculosis. Trials of gold therapy in tuberculosis were unsuccessful, but clinically apparent antiinflammatory activity was found during treatment of patients with discoid lupus erythematosus, which at that time was believed to be due to tuberculosis. Chrysotherapy was introduced in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis in the 1930s and it became a common approach to management of severe rheumatoid arthritis until the 1960s, when it was gradually replaced by more modern forms of disease modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) such as methotrexate, leflunomide, d-penicillamine, hydroxychloroquine, sulfasalazine, enteracept and imfliximab. Previous formulations of gold salts included a parenteral form as gold sodium thiomalate which was available as 50 mg/mL under brand names including Aurolate and Myochrysine (now no longer generally available in the United States). The recommended dose was 10 mg intramuscularly once weekly, gradually increasing to a maintenance dose of 25 to 50 mg weekly or every other week. An oral form of gold, audafolin (aw ran' o fin), continues to be available as capsules of 3 mg under the brand name of Ridaura, the recommended dose of which is 3 to 9 mg daily. Therapy with gold salts is often limited by toxicity, some of which is cumulative. The effect may take weeks to months to occur, but therapy should be discontinued after an accumulative dose of 1 gram if beneficial results are not achieved. Common side effects include abdominal discomfort, nausea, pruritus, skin rash, urticaria and proteinuria. Fatal instances of hypersensitivity reactions, renal dysfunction and bone marrow suppression have been reported.</p>

        <sec id="Gold_Preparations.Hepatotoxicity">
          <title>Hepatotoxicity</title>
          <p>Therapy with parenterally administered gold salts was linked with instances of acute liver injury shortly after being introduced into therapy in the 1930s. The nature of the liver injury was not well defined. The more modern formulations of gold appear to have a lower overall incidence of toxicity, including hepatotoxicity. Mild elevations in serum aminotransferase levels are not infrequent during therapy with gold, but clinically apparent liver injury is rare and appears to be idiosyncratic in nature and has been reported only with parenteral gold therapy. The onset of injury is within 1 to 8 weeks of starting therapy and presents with fever and rash, followed by malaise, nausea, right upper quadrant pain, dark urine and jaundice. Pruritus can be prominent and the typical pattern of serum enzyme elevations is cholestatic or mixed. Recovery may be delayed but is usually complete within 6 to 8 weeks. Transient thrombocytopenia and anemia can occur, particularly in children. Autoantibody formation is not typical, although patients with rheumatoid arthritis are prone to have preexisting autoantibodies. A less frequent pattern of injury from gold therapy is marked by acute hepatic necrosis, usually arising within 1 to 4 weeks of starting therapy with marked elevations in serum aminotransferase levels (20 to 100 fold) and minimal increases in alkaline phosphatase. These cases of acute hepatocellular injury may be associated with high doses of parenteral gold salts and can be severe and have resulted in fatalities. A striking phenomenon is that symptoms of arthritis frequently improve during acute hepatic injury whether due to gold therapy or viral hepatitis. The improvements, however, are transient and of no lasting benefit.</p>
          <p>Likelihood score (parenteral gold preparations): A (well known cause of clinically apparent liver injury).</p>
          <p>Oral gold therapy has been associated with transient, mild elevations in serum aminotransferase levels, but there have been no convincing cases of clinically significant liver injury linked to oral preparations. Thus, idiosyncratic acute liver injury due to auranofin must be very rare, if it occurs at all.</p>
          <p>Likelihood score (oral gold preparations): E* (unlikely although suspected cause of clinically apparent liver injury).</p>
        </sec>
        <sec id="Gold_Preparations.Mechanism_of_Injury">
          <title>Mechanism of Injury</title>
          <p>The typical acute liver injury from parenteral gold therapy appears to be related to hypersensitivity and is often accompanied by other allergic manifestations such as fever, rash, lymphadenopathy and eosinophilia. Cases of short latency onset, acute hepatic necrosis due to injections of gold more closely resemble direct, acute toxicity and have been reported after acute intentional or unintentional overdose of gold salts.</p>
        </sec>
        <sec id="Gold_Preparations.Outcome_and_Management">
          <title>Outcome and Management</title>
          <p>Most cases of jaundice from parenteral gold therapy are self-limited, although recovery may be prolonged. There is little evidence that chelation improves outcome or speeds recovery, although it is often used with acute overdose of a gold containing compound. Rare instances of acute hepatic necrosis soon after initiation of gold therapy have been reported, some of which have been fatal. Rechallenge after clinically apparent hepatotoxicity can lead to severe recurrence and should be avoided. In situations of mild serum aminotransferase elevations during gold therapy, reinstitution of treatment without recurrent elevations is typical.</p>

          <p>A 10 year old boy with suspected juvenile idiopathic (rheumatoid) arthritis was started on parenteral gold therapy in a dose of 40 mg daily for eight days (in error, as it was meant to be given twice weekly) and developed fever, rash and headaches by day nine, followed by severe nausea and vomiting leading to electrolyte imbalance and dehydration. Three days after stopping the gold injections, he was found to be jaundiced with pruritus, dark urine and light stools. The serum bilirubin was 14.6 mg/dL, alkaline phosphatase 630 U/L and ALT 130 U/L (Table). His fever and rash persisted for a week, but then improved rapidly with prednisone therapy. He remained jaundiced for a month with symptoms of pruritus and prominent elevations in serum alkaline phosphatase. A liver biopsy showed intrahepatic cholestasis. Electron microscopy demonstrated scattered gold particles in lysosomes of Kupffer cells and hepatocytes. Over the following 4 weeks the jaundice cleared and, by 6 weeks, laboratory abnormalities had returned to normal. His arthritis was managed with indomethacin.</p>

            <p>A cholestatic hepatitis in a child arising within a few days of stopping an 8 day course of gold therapy. The dose of gold was excessive and was meant to be given twice weekly rather than daily. Nevertheless, the pattern of injury was typical of a hypersensitivity reaction with fever and rash (DRESS syndrome, although no mention made of eosinophil counts). While the rash and fever appeared to respond to prednisone therapy, the jaundice was more persistent. Chelation therapy was not used.</p>

          <title>Case 2. Acute cholestatic hepatitis due to gold therapy in an adult.</title>
          <p>[Modified from: Pessayre D, Feldmann G, Degott C, Ulmann A, Roger W, Erlinger S, Benhamou JP. Gold salt-induced cholestasis. Digestion 1979; 19: 56-64. <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/156659">PubMed Citation</ext-link>]</p>
          <p>A 66 year old woman with suspected rheumatoid arthritis was treated with parenteral injections of gold salts twice weekly for 4 weeks and developed nausea and vomiting followed by rash, jaundice and pruritus. She had no history of liver disease and did not drink alcohol. No mention was made of other medications being taken. On presentation, the serum bilirubin was 32.5 mg/dL, ALT 550 U/L, and alkaline phosphatase 72 Bodansky units (16 fold elevated) (Table). Her jaundice worsened despite stopping gold therapy. ERCP showed a normal biliary tract, and liver biopsy showed marked intrahepatic cholestasis. The rash became exfoliative and persisted for 2 months, while jaundice lasted for 3 months. More extensive evaluation of her joint complaints demonstrated Waldenstrom&#x02019;s macroglobulinemia with involvement of the knee joint. When seen in follow up 9 months later for recurrence of arthritis, she was anicteric and asymptomatic of liver disease, but had mild elevations in alkaline phosphatase.</p>
