          <title>Introduction</title>
          <p>Garcinia cambogia is an herbal product derived from the fruit of the Malabar tamarind tree native to Southeastern Asia which is used as a food preservative and flavoring agent and has recently been used increasingly in herbal weight loss products. Weight loss products labeled as containing Garcinia cambogia been linked to the development of clinically apparent acute liver injury which can be severe and even fatal.</p>

        <sec id="GarciniaCambogia.Background">
          <title>Background</title>
          <p>Garcinia cambogia is an herbal product derived from fruit of the Malabar tamarind tree (also called Garcinia gummi-gutta) which is native to India, Nepal and Sri Lanka. The dried and smoked rind of the Garcinia cambogia fruit is commonly used as a food preservative and, because of its sharp, sour taste, as a flavoring agent and spice, especially in fish curries. The fruit rind has also been used in Ayurvedic medicine to treat gastrointestinal complaints and rheumatism. More recently, Garcinia cambogia has been purported to be an appetite suppressant effective in inducing weight loss. Chemical components of Garcinia extracts include xanthones, benzophenones, amino acids and organic acids, most importantly hydroxycitric acid (HCA) the suspected ingredient responsible for its antiinflammatory and appetite suppressant activity. Garcinia fruit is 10% to 30% HCA by weight, and extracts can contain between 20% and 60% of the tricarboxylic acid. HCA inhibits ATP citrate lyase an enzyme involved in fatty acid synthesis. Garcinia derivatives and HCA have been shown to cause appetite suppression and weight loss in rats, but the effects of these organic acids and Garcinia extracts have not been consistently found in human studies. Nevertheless, Garcinia cambogia is a frequent component of over-the-counter multiingredient herbal products and has been advertised as a weight loss product. Studies in rats and other animal models have suggested that Garcinia cambogia and HCA do not have significant toxicities, although testicular toxicity was found with high doses. In humans, Garcinia has been linked to rare reports of serotonin syndrome, rhabdomyolysis and hepatic toxicity, but the role of Garcinia as opposed to other components of the herbal products or mixtures typically used in humans has not been clearly defined.</p>
        </sec>
        <sec id="GarciniaCambogia.Hepatotoxicity">
          <title>Hepatotoxicity</title>
          <p>There have been at least a dozen reports of Garcinia induced liver injury in individuals taking multiingredient dietary supplements (MIDS) that contain Garcinia cambogia. In some instances, other known or suspected hepatotoxins were present in the MIDS products (such as with Exilis, Herbalife and Hydroxycut products). More recently, cases of acute liver injury have been identified in persons taking a product labelled as having Garcinia cambogia alone. The frequency of hepatic adverse reactions to Garcinia cambogia is not known but is likely uncommon and in less than 1:10,000 persons. Patients typically present with fatigue, nausea, elevations in serum aminotransferase levels, and jaundice 1 to 4 weeks after starting the product, although the latency to onset has been longer (3 to 12 months) in some cases. The pattern of enzyme elevations is hepatocellular, and immune features are not common. Some cases have been severe, resulting in acute liver failure and either death or need for urgent liver transplantation. Recurrence upon reexposure has not been clearly shown.</p>
          <p>Likelihood score: B (likely rare cause of clinically apparent liver injury).</p>
        </sec>
        <sec id="GarciniaCambogia.Mechanism_of_Injury">
          <title>Mechanism of Injury</title>
          <p>The cause of hepatotoxicity from Garcinia cambogia is unclear. In vitro studies suggest that HCA may be toxic to the liver in high doses, but the rare instances of acute liver injury that occur with Garcinia cambogia suggest an idiosyncratic form of injury. The possibility of mislabeling or adulteration with hepatotoxic herbal products is always an issue in herbal related injury.</p>
        </sec>
        <sec id="GarciniaCambogia.Outcome_and_Management">
          <title>Outcome and Management</title>
          <p>The severity of liver injury ranges from transient and moderate enzyme elevations to symptomatic acute hepatitis to acute liver failure. In most instances, the liver injury subsides within 1 to 3 months of discontinuing the herbal product, but if fulminant hepatitis develops, a liver transplant may be required. Rechallenge should be avoided.</p>
          <p>Other Names: Gamboge, Brindleberry, Malabar tamarind. There are at least 400 species of Garcinia other than cambogia (gummi-gutta) which may or may not have similar antiinflammatory and appetite suppressant activity or similar concentrations of HCA. Indeed, mislabeling other Garcinia species as cambogia may account for some instances of unexpected toxicity.</p>

          <p>A 61 year old woman developed abdominal pain, nausea, dark urine and jaundice approximately 6 weeks after starting a weight loss product called Super Ananas Slim, which was labelled as containing Garcinia cambogia. She had no history of liver disease, alcohol abuse or exposure to hepatotoxins or acetaminophen. Her other medical conditions included history of cholecystectomy, dyslipidemia and hypothyroidism and her only other medication was levothyroxine. Two weeks after onset of symptoms, laboratory tests showed a serum bilirubin of 22.5 mg/dL (direct 16.7 mg/dL), ALT 1629 U/L, AST 1121 U/L, alkaline phosphatase 150 U/L and INR 2.2. She tested negative for hepatitis A, B and C and for routine autoantibodies. Despite stopping the herbal product, jaundice and symptoms worsened and persisted for several weeks, but ultimately resolved although serum aminotransferase levels remained mildly elevated 5 months later.</p>

            <p>This patient developed a moderately severe acute hepatitis-like syndrome within 6 weeks of starting a multiingredient weight loss product called &#x0201c;Ananas Slim&#x0201d; which contained Garcinia cambogia as the primary ingredient, but it had other components including Ananas comosus (pineapple) and Ilex paraguariensis (Yerba mate), neither of which have been implicated in hepatotoxicity or other adverse effects. Similar to other reports of Garcinia associated liver injury, the latency to onset was rather brief (6 weeks) and the clinical features were an acute hepatocellular injury with significant jaundice and hepatic dysfunction. The injury was fairly severe and liver test abnormalities were still present 5 months later.</p>
