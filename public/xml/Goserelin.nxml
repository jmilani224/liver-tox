          <title>Introduction</title>
          <p>Goserelin is a parenterally administered, gonadotropin releasing hormone (GnRH) agonist which causes an inhibition of estrogen and androgen production and is used predominantly to treat prostate cancer. Goserelin has been associated with a modest rate of serum enzyme elevations during therapy, but has not been convincingly linked to instances of clinically apparent acute liver injury.</p>
        </sec>
        <sec id="Goserelin.Background">
          <title>Background</title>
          <p>Goserelin (goe" se rel' in) is a synthetic decapeptide analogue of gonadotropin releasing hormone that acts as a partial agonist of the gonadotropin receptors in the pituitary that regulate luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) secretion. These gonadotropins cause production and secretion of testosterone by the male testes and estrogen by the female ovaries. The continued receptor occupancy by goserelin, however, ultimately causes a down-regulation of production of LH and FSH and a resultant decrease in testosterone and estrogen levels. Goserelin, alone or in combination with other antiandrogens, has been found to be palliative in advanced prostate cancer. Goserelin was approved for use in the United States in 1989 and is still widely used, being considered important adjuvant therapy in management of advanced prostate cancer. Goserelin is also approved for use in advanced breast cancer and for several hormonally sensitive benign conditions such as endometriosis. The GnRH agonists have also been used off label for precocious puberty and infertility. Goserelin is available under the brand name Zoladex in solution for administration subcutaneously as implants every 4 (3.6 mg) or 12 (10.8 mg) weeks. Goserelin and the other GnRH analogues cause a profound hypogonadism ("chemical castration") and its common side effects are typical of androgen deprivation, including hot flashes, loss of libido, erectile dysfunction, depression, nausea, diarrhea, weight gain and fluid retention. Rare, but potentially severe adverse events can include immediate hypersensitivity reactions, pituitary apoplexy and, with long term use, weight gain, metabolic changes, diabetes and osteoporosis.</p>
        </sec>
        <sec id="Goserelin.Hepatotoxicity">
          <title>Hepatotoxicity</title>
          <p>Goserelin has been associated with mild serum enzyme elevations during therapy in 3% to 5% of patients, but values above 3 times the upper limit of normal are rare, being reported in less than 1% of recipients. The serum enzyme elevations during goserelin therapy have generally been transient and asymptomatic, resolving even with drug continuation and rarely requiring dose modification or discontinuation. Despite use for several decades, goserelin has been linked to only a single, and not entirely convincing, case of clinically apparent liver injury. Routine monitoring of patients for liver test abnormalities is not recommended.</p>
          <p>Likelihood score: D (possible, rare cause of clinically apparent liver injury).</p>
        </sec>
        <sec id="Goserelin.Mechanism_of_Injury">
          <title>Mechanism of Injury</title>
          <p>The cause of liver test abnormalities during goserelin therapy is not known. Goserelin is a short peptide and is metabolized locally in many tissues. It is not metabolized to an appreciable extent by the hepatic cytochrome P450 system and has not been associated with significant drug-drug interactions. Some serum enzyme elevations may be caused by nonalcoholic fatty liver arising because of weight gain or metabolic changes caused by the androgen deprivation state induced by the GnRH agonist.</p>
        </sec>
        <sec id="Goserelin.Outcome_and_Management">
          <title>Outcome and Management</title>
          <p>The serum enzyme elevations that occur on goserelin therapy usually do not require dose adjustment or drug discontinuation, but should lead to a search for other causes of liver disease. There is no evidence to indicate that there is cross sensitivity to liver injury among the various GnRH analogues.</p>
