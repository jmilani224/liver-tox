          <title>Introduction</title>
          <p>Isoniazid is the most reliable and most commonly used medication for tuberculosis. Isoniazid therapy is often associated with minor, transient and asymptomatic elevations in serum aminotransferase levels but, more importantly, isoniazid is a well known cause of acute clinically apparent liver injury which can be severe and is sometimes fatal.</p>

        <sec id="Isoniazid.Background">
          <title>Background</title>
          <p>Isoniazid (eye' soe nye' a zid) or isonicotinic acid hydrazine is a potent antimycobacterial agent which is thought to act by inhibition of lipid and DNA synthesis of Mycobacterium tuberculosis, thus inhibiting its cell wall synthesis. Isoniazid was introduced into clinical practice in 1954 and contributed greatly to the subsequent dramatic decrease in morbidity and mortality of tuberculosis. In early studies, isoniazid was found to have few side effects, excellent complicance and rapid efficacy. Isoniazid rapidly became the mainstay of antituberculosis therapy but, because of the frequency of antibacterial resistance, was always used in combination with other agents. Rare instances of clinically apparent liver injury were reported in patients on antituberculosis therapy, but were usually attributed to the other agents being used (such as paraaminosalyclic acid [PAS]). In 1963, isoniazid was recommended as monotherapy for prevention of active disease in patients with latent tuberculosis, diagnosed on the basis of a positive purified protein derivative (PPD) tuberculin skin test. Cases of severe hepatotoxicity due to isoniazid alone soon appeared and clearly defined its hepatotoxic potential. Recommendations on use of isoniazid were then modified and restricted.</p>
          <p>Because of the rapid development of antibacterial resistance, therapy of active tuberculosis usually employs two or more agents. Most modern antituberculosis regimens include the combination of isoniazid with either rifampin or pyrazinamide, or both. In cases of suspected or proven multidrug resistance, ethambutol or streptomycin may be added. Isoniazid is available in generic forms in tablets of 100 and 300 mg and as an oral solution of 50 mg/5 mL. Isoniazid is also available in fixed combinations with rifampin (Rifamate and Isonarif: isoniazid 150 mg with rifampin 300 mg) and pyrazinamide (Rifater: isoniazid 50 mg with rifampin 120 mg and pyrazinamide 300 mg). The recommended dose of isoniazid in adults is 300 mg (~5 mg/kg) daily or up to 900 mg (~15 mg/kg) once or twice weekly, either alone (in prevention) or in combination with other antituberculosis medications such as rifampin, pyrazinamide, streptomycin, and ethambutol. Once and twice weekly regimens are often used, because these regimens allow for directly observed therapy that is highly effective in improving compliance and completion rates. Common side effects include gastrointestinal upset, nausea, fever and rash. High doses of isoniazid can cause peripheral neuropathy which is preventable with concurrent administration of pyridoxine (vitamin B6). Guidelines and detailed discussion of therapy of tuberculosis is available at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention website: http://www.cdc.gov/tb/publications/guidelines/Treatment.htm.</p>

        <sec id="Isoniazid.Hepatotoxicity">
          <title>Hepatotoxicity</title>
          <p>Despite its limited use, isoniazid remains one of the most common causes of serious, idiosyncratic liver injury in the United States. Therapy with isoniazid is associated with transient serum aminotransferase elevations in 10% to 20% of patients, and levels rising above 5 times the upper limit of the normal range (ULN) in 3% to 5%. These enzyme elevations are usually asymptomatic and often resolve even with continuation of therapy without dose adjustment (Case 1 and 2).</p>
          <p>In addition, isoniazid can also cause clinically apparent acute liver injury with jaundice, which arises in 0.5% to 1% and is fatal in 0.05 to 0.1% of recipients. Rates of hepatic injury vary greatly in the published literature. A major determinant of the variability is probably age. The rates of clinically apparent hepatitis due to isoniazid are estimated at 0.5% in patients 20 to 35 years of age, 1.5% in those 35 to 50 years of age, and 3% or higher in persons above the age of 50 years. Isoniazid hepatotoxicity is rare in children (but still occurs and can be fatal). Other risk factors are preexisting liver disease (hepatitis B or C), concurrent use of rifampin or pyrazinamide, and possibly alcoholism, black race and genetic factors. The typical time to onset of injury ranges from 2 weeks to 6 months, but can be as long as one year and as short as one week. The onset is usuallly insidious and resembles acute viral hepatitis with a prodromal period of nausea, anorexia, abdominal discomfort and fatigue, which is followed by dark urine and jaundice (Case 3 and 4). The pattern of liver enzyme elevations is typically hepatocellular with marked increases in ALT levels (&#x0003e;10 times ULN) and minimal increases in alkaline phosphatase values (usually &#x0003c;2 times ULN). Most frequently, the injury is self-limited and begins to resolve within a week of stopping isoniazid. However, at least 10% of jaundiced cases are severe and can be fatal or require emergency liver transplantation (Case 4 and 5). Acute liver failure from isoniazid appears to be more common in women than men, and in African Americans more than Caucasians. Severe outcomes are also probably related to delays in stopping therapy in symptomatic cases, pre-existing liver disease and concurrent use of other potentially hepatoxici medications. Features of hypersensitivity such as rash, fever and eosinophilia can occur, but are uncommon and usually mild if present at all. Isoniazid therapy can induce antinuclear antibodies even without hepatotoxicity or hypersensitivity reactions. For this reason, autoantibodies may be present during acute hepatic injury due to isoniazid, but they are generally low in titer and not accompanied by other features of autoimmune liver injury (hyperglobulinemia, arthralgias). Liver histology resembles acute viral hepatitis, but may show increased numbers of eosinophils or prominence of cholestasis.</p>

        <sec id="Isoniazid.Mechanism_of_Injury">
          <title>Mechanism of Injury</title>
          <p>The cause of liver injury due to isoniazid is believed to be accumulation of a toxic intermediate of its metabolism. Rates of injury may be somewhat higher in patients with a slow acetylation status, marked by genotypic variants in N-acetylation, or with abnormalities in CYP 2E1, the second major enzymatic pathway of its metabolism. Risk factors for developing isoniazid hepatotoxicity are older age and possibly alcohol use, cirrhosis, Asian race, malnutrition, underlying chronic hepatitis B or C, slow acetylator status, and use in combination with other antituberculosis medications. Despite the lack of prominent features of hypersensitivity, rapid recurrence of injury can occur with rechallenge, suggesting that the injury is immune-mediated, at least in part.</p>
        </sec>
        <sec id="Isoniazid.Outcome_and_Management">
          <title>Outcome and Management</title>
          <p>While isoniazid commonly causes serum ALT elevations, it is unclear at which level of elevation isoniazid should be stopped and whether monitoring of liver tests is effective in avoiding the clinically significant hepatotoxicity of this agent. Importantly, the appearance of any symptoms of hepatitis (fatigue, nausea, poor appetite or jaundice) accompanied by liver enzyme elevations should lead to the immediate discontinuation of isoniazid. Using the appearance of clinical symptoms to guide decisions on discontinuation appears to be partially effective in preventing serious injury in patients on isoniazid therapy, but patients need to be carefully instructed and regularly reminded to pay attention to new onset of symptoms of fatigue or nausea that persist for more than a day and, if symptoms arise, to have serum enzyme levels tested promptly. If biochemical monitoring is done (generally at monthly intervals initially), isoniazid should be discontinued for any confirmed elevation of ALT above 5 times the ULN (or above 3 times ULN in the presence of symptoms). Biochemical monitoring is usually recommended for patients at high risk of developing hepatotoxicty--those with preexisting liver disease or above the age of 50 years. Even with monitoring, isoniazid remains a major cause of acute liver failure due to idiosyncratic reactions, and is associated with several instances of acute liver failure and death or emergency liver transplanation in the United States each year.</p>
          <p>Chronic liver injury from isoniazid is rare and cases of vanishing bile duct syndrome have not been reported. There are no specific therapies for isoniazid induced liver injury. Corticosteroids are often used, but there is scant evidence for their benefit. A recent trial has suggested that N-acetylcysteine administration early in the course of acute severe liver injury due to medications improves spontaneous survival rates. Rechallenge with isoniazid can result in recurrence, but not always. Indeed, in prospective studies, up to 80% of persons with suspected isoniazid induced liver injury have tolerated reintroduction of treatment once the initial injury has resolved. Restarting therapy, however, should be done with caution and limited to mild cases, or those with serum enzyme elevations only and those in whom isoniazid is considered essential.</p>
          <p>[First line medications used in the therapy of tuberculosis in the US include ethambutol, isoniazid, pyrazinamide, rifabutin, rifampin, and rifapentine. Second line medications include streptomycin, capreomycin, cycloserine, ethionamide, fluoroquinolones such as levofloxacin and moxifloxacin, aminoglycosides such as amikacin, and para-aminosalicylic acid (PAS).]</p>

          <p>Despite developing evidence of liver injury with jaundice, these two patients continued therapy with isoniazid and recovered completely (#1) or partially (#2). Serum aminotransferase elevations occur in 10% to 20% of patients treated with isoniazid for 1 year, but levels are usually minimally elevated and transient and are rarely (~1%) associated with symptoms. The aminotransferase elevations generally arise within the first 12 weeks of therapy, but can appear as late as 48 weeks. In up to 5% of patients, aminotransferase levels rise to at least 3 times the upper limit of normal and a proportion of these patients develop jaundice. It is prudent to stop therapy for any elevation of ALT or AST above 5 fold the upper limit of normal or for sustained values above 3 times the upper limit of normal, and certainly for any symptoms or appearance of jaundice. However, as shown in these two cases, &#x0201c;adaptation&#x0201d; and spontaneous recovery can occur even with fairly high aminotransferase elevations. The difficulty is that injury can be sustained and severe and result in acute liver failure. Furthermore, there are no reliable predictive features for recovery versus progressive damage. In this study, the laboratory testing was done in retrospect and results were not available until the study was over. Of course, tests for hepatitis A, B and C were not available at the time and the possible contribution of viral hepatitis to the abnormalities could not be assessed. Because the patients did not have symptoms of liver injury, therapy was continued.</p>

          <title>Case 3. Acute hepatitis due to isoniazid.</title>
          <p>[Modified from a case in the database of the Drug-Induced Liver Injury Network.]</p>
          <p>A 66 year old Hispanic man developed nausea followed by dark urine and jaundice 6 weeks after starting isoniazid for latent tuberculosis. He had been in good health except for hypertension for which he had been taking enalapril for more than a decade. Because of a positive purified protein derivative (PPD) tuberculin skin test, he was started on a 6 month course of isoniazid [300 mg daily with pyridoxine]. Laboratory tests taken before starting therapy were normal except for a slightly raised total serum bilirubin. He remained asymptomatic until onset of nausea and indigestion during week 6 of therapy. He denied fever or rash. He had not taken any over-the-counter medications, herbals or acetaminophen. He had a history of heavy drinking but had stopped 4 years previously. Physical examination showed jaundice but no signs of chronic liver disease. Laboratory tests showed a total bilirubin of 6.3 mg/dL and marked elevations in ALT but minimal increase in alkaline phosphatase levels (Table). Tests for hepatitis A, B and C were negative. Serum ANA was strongly positive (1:20,480), but smooth muscle antibody was negative, and immunoglobulin levels were normal. Liver imaging showed no evidence of biliary obstruction. Liver biopsy was not done. Isoniazid was stopped promptly and he began to improve within days. Enalapril was restarted but therapy for latent tuberculosis was not pursued. One month later, he was asymptomatic and liver tests had returned to baseline.</p>

            <p>An acute viral hepatitis-like syndrome arising 6 weeks after starting therapy is typical of isoniazid hepatitis. Symptoms and signs may worsen for a few days after stopping but then usually improve rapidly. Immunoallergic features are unusual and, if present, are mild. Isoniazid therapy can induce ANA reactivity, but autoantibodies titers are usually low [making this case somewhat atypical] and not associated with other features that would suggest autoimmune hepatitis. Age above 35 years is the single major risk factor for isoniazid hepatitis. Alcohol use may also be a risk factor, but it is not clear whether the risk is related to concurrent use or with an alcohol history (probably the former). Treatment of latent tuberculosis in persons over the age of 35 should be done with caution. Patients should be informed of the risk of liver injury and warned of the signs and symptoms of liver injury. Routine biochemical monitoring is prudent if there is pre-existing liver disease or perceived increased risk for liver injury. The mortality rate of isoniazid hepatitis with jaundice is at least 10%.</p>

          <title>Case 4. Acute liver failure due to isoniazid.</title>
          <p>[Modified from a case in the database of the Drug-Induced Liver Injury Network.]</p>
          <p>A 58 year old Korean-American woman was found to have a positive tuberculin test when undergoing a routine physical examination at the time of changing her health plan. A chest X-ray was normal; despite this, she was started on isoniazid (300 mg daily) and pyridoxine (50 mg daily) for latent tuberculosis. Six months after starting isoniazid, she began to feel unwell and subsequently developed nausea, dark urine and jaundice. After being symptomatic for at least a week, she consulted her nephew for advice who told her to stop the isoniazid and seek medical help immediately. On presentation, she complained of fatigue, nausea and dark urine but denied fever, rash or pruritus. She had no previous history of liver disease and did not drink alcohol or take other medications or herbal products. Physical examination showed no evidence of chronic liver disease. Laboratory tests showed a serum bilirubin of 8.6 mg/dL, ALT 781 U/L and alkaline phosphatase of 185 U/L (Table). Isoniazid was discontinued and she was followed carefully as an outpatient. She was reactive for both anti-HBs and anti-HBc but HBsAg and IgM anti-HBc were negative as were tests for hepatitis A and C and serum autoantibodies. Ultrasound of the abdomen showed a mild degree of ascites and the liver appeared small and possibly cirrhotic. There were gallstones but no evidence of biliary obstruction. Serum bilirubin peaked two days later at 13.3 mg/dL and concurrent INR was 1.5. Thereafter, she improved and six weeks later was almost back to normal but refused further follow up.</p>

            <p>The frequency of hepatitis due to isoniazid increases with age and rates of hepatitis with jaundice in persons above the age of 55 are as high as 3%. Patients on antituberculosis therapy should be carefully warned of the risk of liver injury and told of the symptoms that should lead them to stop therapy or seek immediate medical advice these being fatigue lasting more than a day, nausea, dark urine and jaundice. This patient delayed stopping isoniazid and the subsequent liver injury was severe with ultrasound evidence of ascites and prolongation of the prothrombin time. She remained jaundiced for over a month and blood tests had not returned to normal levels when she was seen 6 weeks after stopping isoniazid. She refused further follow up.</p>

          <p>A 60 year old woman with pulmonary tuberculosis was treated with isoniazid (300 mg daily), rifampin (600 mg daily) and pyrazinamide (1.5 grams daily) and improved rapidly, but was found to have jaundice with bilirubin 3.5 mg/dL, AST 538 U/L and alkaline phosphatase of 148 U/L six weeks after starting therapy (Table). Her liver tests were reported to be normal before treatment. She had no history of liver disease, alcohol abuse, or risk factors for viral hepatitis. Isoniazid and rifampin were stopped, but pyrazinamide continued. One week later, she was admitted to a local hospital for worsening hepatic function. She was mildly encephalopathic and the prothrombin time was prolonged. She was transferred to a liver transplant center. She was in stage 3 hepatic coma and required artificial ventilation. Pyrazinamide was stopped and ofloxacin, ethambutol and streptomycin started. Blood tests for hepatitis A, B and C were negative. She underwent successful liver transplantation 5 days after transfer and 3 weeks after onset of symptoms. She recovered uneventfully and was discharged 16 days after transplant on cyclosporine and prednisone. She was maintained on ethambutol, streptomycin and ofloxacin for tuberculosis, and sputum cultures remained negative.</p>

            <p>An acute viral-hepatitis like presentation of drug-induced liver disease that was most likely due to isoniazid. While the case represents &#x0201c;definite&#x0201d; drug induced liver disease, it is impossible to be so definitive about which agent was responsible. Isoniazid is most likely, but pyrazinamide and, to a lesser degree, rifampin are also capable of causing acute severe liver injury. Despite stopping therapy promptly, the patient progressed to hepatic failure and required liver transplantation within 3 weeks of initial presentation. Risk factors for isoniazid hepatitis included age and combination therapy. Risk factors for severe outcome were age and sex.</p>
