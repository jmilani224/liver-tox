          <title>Introduction</title>
          <p>Antithymocyte globulin (ATG) is an antibody preparation derived from rabbits or horses hyperimmunized with human thymocytes, which is used to prevent or treat acute cellular rejection after solid organ transplantation and as a therapy of acute aplastic anemia. ATG has been linked to acute elevations in serum enzyme elevations shortly following infusions, but has not been linked to cases of clinically apparent liver injury. ATG is a potent immunosuppressive agent and may result in reactivation of hepatitis B in susceptible patients.</p>

        <sec id="AntithymocyteGlobuli.Background">
          <title>Background</title>
          <p>Antithymocyte globulin is a hyperimmune globulin preparation made from plasma of rabbits or horses that have been immunized with human thymocytes or T cells. ATG is given by infusion only and leads to a rapid decrease in circulating T cells. ATG has been shown to be effective in preventing and treating acute cellular rejection after renal transplantation, and has been used extensively for the same indications after heart and liver transplantation. The antibodies are polyclonal and are directed at multiple T cell markers (such as CD2, CD3, CD4, CD8, CD 11) as well as HLA markers, beta-2-microglobulin and other tissue antigens (including cytoplasmic and nuclear liver antigens). Equine ATG is also used to treat severe aplastic anemia. ATG was initially approved for use in the United States as treatment of acute cellular rejection after renal transplantation. Since then, the indications for its use have been broadened, although there remains considerable off label use as well. Two commercial products are available in the United States: Thymoglobulin (rabbit ATG) and Atgam (horse ATG). Dose regimens vary by product and clinical indications. The usual regimen for treating acute rejection in adults is a 7 to 14 day course of daily infusion of 1.5 mg/kg of Thymoglobulin or 15 mg/kg of Atgam. ATG is typically used in combination with other immunosuppressive agents and should be prescribed only by physicians experienced in management of immunosuppression. Adverse events are common during ATG administration, but many are due to the underlying condition and other complications of organ transplantation or aplastic anemia. Because ATG is made from animal serum, it can induce serious immune mediated reactions such as acute infusion reactions, anaphylaxis, serum sickness and cytokine release syndrome. ATG is a foreign protein (xenotypic) and may induce inactivating antibodies with repeated use. Furthermore, the initial engagement of T cells by the antibody can result in a transient, acute release of proinflammatory cytokines (cytokine release syndrome) with symptoms of high fever, weakness, dyspnea, nausea, chest pain and diarrhea arising within the first two days of starting therapy. Less common, but potentially severe adverse reactions reported to occur after ATG therapy include bacterial and opportunistic infections, reactivation of viral infections (EBV, HSV, CMV, HBV, RSV, among others), acute thromboses, and malignancies, particularly EBV-associated lymphoproliferative disorders.</p>
        </sec>
        <sec id="AntithymocyteGlobuli.Hepatotoxicity">
          <title>Hepatotoxicity</title>
          <p>When given as a part of induction therapy for solid organ transplantation, ATG has not been linked to serum enzyme elevations or hepatotoxicity, but it is given with other medications and in preparation for major surgery so that some degree of liver injury might well be missed. In patients with aplastic anemia given ATG, transient serum enzyme elevations arising a few days after the infusions have been reported to occur in up to one-third of patients. These abnormalities generally resolve spontaneously without jaundice or symptoms. Serum alkaline phosphatase and bilirubin levels rise minimally, if at all. There have been no convincing cases of acute, clinically apparent liver injury caused by ATG infusions. Indeed, administration of ATG for acute rejection after liver transplantation is usually followed by a prompt decrease in serum enzymes and jaundice, and administration of ATG for aplastic anemia with hepatitis or hepatitis from check point inhibitors such as ipilumumab commonly results in a prompt improvement in the jaundice and serum enzyme elevations. ATG has occasionally been implicated in causing a worsening of chronic hepatitis C after transplantation, but is not generally implicated as a major cause of long term severe outcomes of recurrent hepatitis C infection.</p>
          <p>Likelihood score: E* (unproven, but suspected cause of anicteric liver injury).</p>
          <p>ATG is a potent immunosuppressive agent and may be capable of causing reactivation of chronic hepatitis B. However, when used in prevention of organ rejection it has not been linked to cases of reactivation, perhaps because patients at risk are routinely given prophylaxis and the role of ATG versus other rejection medications (cyclosporine, tacrolimus, corticosteroids) is not clear.</p>
        </sec>
        <sec id="AntithymocyteGlobuli.Mechanism_of_Injury">
          <title>Mechanism of Injury</title>
          <p>The cause of serum enzyme elevations after ATG use is not known, but may relate to cytotoxicity of the polyclonal antibodies to liver cells or to the known propensity of injured, apoptotic T lymphocytes to home to the liver. Liver injury generally arises after ATG infusions have stopped or between courses of treatment.</p>
        </sec>
        <sec id="AntithymocyteGlobuli.Outcome_and_Managem">
          <title>Outcome and Management</title>
          <p>The liver injury associated with ATG therapy is generally mild and self-limited without symptoms or jaundice. The other forms of hypersensitivity reactions to ATG are usually more likely to call for alteration in administration or avoidance of further infusions.</p>
          <p>Monoclonal agents used in the treatment or prevention of transplant rejection include alemtuzumab, basiliximab, daclizumab, and muromonab.</p>
