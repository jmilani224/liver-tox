          <title>Introduction</title>
          <p>Niraparib is a small molecule inhibitor of poly ADP-ribose polymerase that is used in the therapy of selected patients with refractory and advanced ovarian carcinoma. Niraparib therapy is associated with a low rate of transient elevations in serum aminotransferase during therapy, but has not been linked to instances of clinically apparent liver injury.</p>
        </sec>
        <sec id="Niraparib.Background">
          <title>Background</title>
          <p>Niraparib (nye rap' a rib) is an orally available, small molecule inhibitor of poly adenine diphosphate (ADP)-ribose polymerase (PARP), an enzyme involved in DNA transcription and repair. Patients with mutations of the BRCA 1 and 2 genes are at increased risk for cancer, particularly ovarian and breast cancer in women. The BRCA gene encodes DNA repair enzymes, and tumor cells with BRCA mutations have an increased dependence on PARP and increased sensitivity to its inhibition. Clinical trials of niraparib in women with advanced, refractory ovarian, fallopian tube or primary peritoneal carcinoma have shown response rates of 30% to 40% and prolongation of progression-free survival. Niraparib is also under evaluation as therapy for advanced breast cancer and other malignant diseases associated mutations in BRCA or other DNA repair enzymes. Niraparib received approval for use in the United States in 2017 for therapy of advanced and refractory advanced, refractory ovarian, fallopian tube or primary peritoneal carcinoma. Niraparib is available in 100 mg capsules under the brand name Zejula. The recommended dose is 300 mg by mouth once daily continued until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity occurs. Common side effects include anemia, fatigue, nausea, diarrhea, constipation, dyspepsia, abdominal pain, anorexia, shortness of breath and thrombocytopenia. Uncommon, but potentially severe side effects include myelodysplastic syndrome, marked bone marrow suppression, cardiovascular events and embryo-fetal toxicity.</p>
        </sec>
        <sec id="Niraparib.Hepatotoxicity">
          <title>Hepatotoxicity</title>
          <p>In preregistration, randomized controlled clinical trials of niraparib, abnormalities in routine liver tests were common, but were mostly mild and self-limited in course. Serum ALT elevations occurred in 28% of patients (vs 15% of controls), but values were above 5 times the upper limit of normal (ULN) in only 1% (vs 2% of controls). Despite the frequency of serum enzyme elevations during therapy in clinical trials, there were no reports of hepatitis with jaundice or liver failure. Subsequent to its approval and more wide scale use, there have been no published reports of clinically apparent liver injury attributed to niraparib, but the extent and duration of its use have been limited. Thus, niraparib is a known cause of mild serum enzyme elevations but has not been linked to significant hepatotoxicity.</p>
          <p>Likelihood score: E* (unproven but suspected cause of clinically apparent liver injury).</p>
        </sec>
        <sec id="Niraparib.Mechanism_of_Injury">
          <title>Mechanism of Injury</title>
          <p>The mechanism of injury accounting for the serum enzyme elevations during niraparib therapy is not known. Niraparib is metabolized by carboxylesterases to an inactive product. It not metabolized to an appreciable extent by the cytochrome P450 system and has minimal drug-drug interactions.</p>
        </sec>
        <sec id="Niraparib.Outcome_and_Management">
          <title>Outcome and Management</title>
          <p>Serum aminotransferase elevations above 5 times the upper limit of normal (if confirmed) during therapy with niraparib should lead to dose reduction or temporary cessation. There does not appear to be cross reactivity in risk for hepatic injury between niraparib and other PARP inhibitors such as olaparib or rucaparib.</p>
