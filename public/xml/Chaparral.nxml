          <title>Introduction</title>
          <p>Chaparral is a botanical extract of the woody shrub known as creosote bush (Larrea tridentata) which has antioxidant activity and is claimed to have beneficial effects for many conditions from skin rash to cancer. Chaparral extracts have been linked to several cases of clinically apparent liver injury, some of which have led to acute liver failure and need for emergency liver transplantation.</p>

        <sec id="Chaparral.Background">
          <title>Background</title>
          <p>Chaparral is prepared from the leaves of the evergreen desert shrub known as creosote bush (Larrea divaricata, subspecies tridentata), which is found in the southwestern United States and Mexico. The leaves are ground into a powdered extract that can be brewed into tea, which was the form used by Native Americans for centuries to treat various conditions such as respiratory illness, chickenpox, snakebite and arthritis pain. More recently, chaparral has been prepared as a botanical in pill forms as well as in salves for topical application and concentrated extracts to be brewed into tea. Chaparral extracts have multiple active ingredients, the most prominent being nordihydroguaiaretic acid (NDGA), which has potent antioxidant properties. NDGA is found in many plant species and has been used as a food additive in low concentrations. As a botanical extract, chaparral has been claimed to have multiple beneficial effects as a free radical scavenger and useful for weight loss, liver wellness, cleansing of blood, improving immunity (cancer, HIV infection) and treating skin disorders. Chaparral is also claimed to retard aging and aid in wellbeing. However, chaparral preparations have not been shown to be effective in any medical condition.</p>

        <sec id="Chaparral.Hepatotoxicity">
          <title>Hepatotoxicity</title>
          <p>Liver injury attributable to chaparral was first reported in 1990 and subsequently more than two dozen cases of clinically apparent liver injury attributed to chaparral have been published. The time to onset varied from 3 weeks to several years, but was usually within 3 to 12 weeks of starting daily ingestion or increasing the daily dose. The pattern of injury was typically hepatocellular with an acute viral hepatitis-like presentation and marked elevations in serum aminotransferase levels, but minimal increase in alkaline phosphatase. Autoimmune and immunoallergic features were uncommon. Several reported cases have been severe and some have led to emergency liver transplantation. Subclinical cases and serum enzyme elevations without symptoms may occur but have not been well characterized. Despite the several reports of liver injury caused by chaparral, over-the-counter products with chaparral are still available commercially and on the internet. For unclear reasons, there have been no cases of liver injury clearly implicating chaparral published since 2005.</p>

        <sec id="Chaparral.Mechanism_of_Injury">
          <title>Mechanism of Injury</title>
          <p>Chaparral leaf extracts have many components but the most prominent is NDGA, an antioxidant which affects many intrahepatic pathways, including those involving cyclooxygenases and lipoxygenases. The rare cases of liver injury reported with chaparral use have had idiosyncratic features, and the rapid recurrence after reexposure and finding of eosinophils on liver biopsy suggest an allergic or immunological cause of injury. As with other reported herbal toxicities, the liver injury attributed to chaparral may have been due to contaminants or improperly prepared extracts.</p>

        <sec id="Chaparral.Outcome_and_Management">
          <title>Outcome and Management</title>
          <p>Hepatotoxicity from chaparral is rare, but some cases have been severe leading to acute liver failure. Other instances have been reported to lead to cirrhosis, but cases of chronic hepatitis or vanishing bile duct syndrome have not been reported. Recurrence after reexposure has occurred.</p>

          <p>[Modified from: Katz M, Saibil F. Herbal hepatitis: subacute hepatic necrosis secondary to chaparral leaf.

          <p>A 33 year old woman developed anorexia and nausea followed by jaundice 2 to 3 months after starting chaparral leaf (15 tablets per day) for a benign breast lump and general health on the advice of a friend. She decreased the number of tablets taken from 15 to 1 per day and her symptoms improved, but on increasing to 7 per day, she redeveloped nausea, jaundice, pale stools and increase in abdominal girth. Upon stopping chaparral leaf, her appetite returned but she continued to have fatigue and jaundice and sought medical advice. Her medical history was negative for liver disease, alcohol use or risk factors for viral hepatitis. Physical examination showed jaundice, ascites and peripheral edema without rash, fever or splenomegaly. Laboratory tests showed a total serum bilirubin of 12.0 mg/dL with marked elevations in serum aminotransferase levels (ALT 1385 U/L, AST 1285 U/L), with modest increases in alkaline phosphatase (285 U/L). Serum albumin was 2.8 g/dL and prothrombin time was 19 seconds. Tests for acute hepatitis A and B and Epstein Barr virus infection were negative as were autoantibodies. With stopping chaparral, she rapidly improved (Table) and after 3 weeks underwent liver biopsy, which showed severe hepatitis and submassive necrosis. She remained fatigued and had persistence of minor elevations in serum ALT for 12 months after stopping the botanical. In longterm follow-up, liver tests returned to normal.</p>

            <p>This initial case report of severe hepatitis attributed to chaparral use was published 7 years after its occurrence in 1983. A young woman developed a severe viral hepatitis-like syndrome 3 months after starting chaparral and had a temporary improvement on lowering the dose, and subsequent worsening with increasing it. Serum liver tests were not available from these periods of dose adjustment, but the clinical history suggested an association of disease severity with dosage and a positive rechallenge. When she presented to medical evaluation, she had evidence of severe hepatitis with jaundice and marked serum aminotransferase elevations along with ascites and prolongation of the prothrombin time. She began to improve between 1 and 2 weeks after stopping chaparral. A liver biopsy documented the severity of the liver injury (submassive necrosis with an estimated 60% loss of parenchyma). Symptoms and minor serum enzyme elevations persisted for at least 4 months after stopping, with full documentation of resolution when she was seen a year after stopping chaparral. The component of chaparral leaf extracts that is responsible for hepatotoxicity is not known; features of the disease suggest that the liver injury is idiosyncratic rather than a direct toxic effect.</p>
